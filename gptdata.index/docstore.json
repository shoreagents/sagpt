Most of these are fairly basic and don’t require the time of your local staff. Leave it to your property management virtual assistant to handle emails, answer questions about the property, and advise about viewings.\r\n\r\nYour PMVA can schedule inspection appointments using the online calendar and notify prospective tenants of their viewing time.

For instance, “Create 25 Instagram posts using photos from this folder and quotes from the provided testimonials. Research appropriate hashtags and add 3-7 hashtags per post.

Who in your organization will be responsible for reviewing and approving the work completed by your virtual assistant?\r\n\r\nYour outsourced assistant operates without a conventional supervisor and may receive tasks from various staff members without direct oversight. Hence, implementing an approval process is essential to review each task before its release under your business's name.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":2879,"to":2884}}}}],["363",{"pageContent":"There are various tools you can use to track task progress and ensure that an approval process is in place. Project management apps like Trello or Asana can help, or you can use a simple Excel spreadsheet. The key is to establish an accountability barrier between your virtual assistant and the public representation of your business.\r\n\r\nDon’t neglect the importance of an approval process in real estate outsourcing. Implementing this ensures that your virtual assistant's work aligns with your standards and presents your business in the best possible light.\r\n\r\nAre There Any Downsides to Outsourcing for Real Estate?\r\nOutsourcing is a brilliant way to start trimming the fat from your business and make easy increases to your profit margin. As outlined already, though, there is still a bit of work involved for you. But if you understand your business, you can easily find the low-hanging fruit and start making cost savings immediately.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":2886,"to":2891}}}}],["364",{"pageContent":"The best way to start outsourcing is slowly by starting with one or two simple tasks. It's advisable to hone your process and learn to better understand the system. You may prefer to work with people from one country over another. \r\n\r\nIt is possible that you lack knowledge regarding the appropriate payment amount. You may not realize how difficult a particular task is. Starting out outsourcing can be a relatively low-cost investment, but don’t throw yourself into it all at once. Besides the research involved, there are other downsides that you need to be aware of.\r\n\r\nLack of Loyalty\r\nWhether you hire someone directly through Upwork or via an agency, that person is not necessarily loyal to you. Even the most perfect person on Upwork can suddenly drop you as a client if they get a better offer. No contract between you forces them to give a certain period of notice. Regardless of their affinity for your brand, you are simply one of many clients they serve.\r\n\r\nInconstancy","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":2893,"to":2900}}}}],["365",{"pageContent":"Inconstancy\r\nWhen working with an agency, you’ll be drawing on a pool of specialists.

Yes, the agency should take care of that side. However, if you’re being assigned a different person each month, then you can’t be guaranteed consistency.\r\n\r\nLoss of Privacy\r\nOften you’ll need to share sensitive documents and data to get your tasks done by an outsourced person. Think of what they’ll need access to social media accounts, website passwords, back-end processes, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Docs, etc.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":2900,"to":2906}}}}],["366",{"pageContent":"Certain programs enable you to restrict user access, preventing them from causing significant harm or carrying out unwanted actions.

It is task-specific and there is a different type of outsourcing called offshoring. \r\nThis is where you hire an offshore employee to join your team. If they are supporting one member of your domestic team, they are usually referred to as a real estate virtual assistant.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":2908,"to":2912}}}}],["367",{"pageContent":"This is where you hire an offshore employee to join your team. If they are supporting one member of your domestic team, they are usually referred to as a real estate virtual assistant. \r\n\r\nAlthough an offshore employee will be responsible for a number of different tasks, their role is usually not task-specific. Just like any of your other staff, they fulfill a role, not just a task. So whereas outsourcing is task-specific, an offshore employee is role-specific.\r\n\r\nMoving from Outsourcing to Offshoring\r\nIn our experience, a real estate business will typically outsource a specific task for a defined period of time. A good example is lease renewals. A real estate agency finds that it has fallen behind in this area. \r\n\r\nThey hire an offshore team member through an outsourcing company to handle lease renewals for 3 to 6 months. The contracting company is accountable for training, supervising, and overseeing the progress of this task on a daily basis.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":2912,"to":2919}}}}],["368",{"pageContent":"Keep in mind that in this example, the person assigned to your business is not your employee. However, they will be working only on your business so there are fewer problems associated with loyalty. \r\n\r\nReal estate companies often explore outsourcing as they contemplate their offshore requirements. However, the complexity of their needs may surpass their suitability. While outsourcing works well for the aforementioned tasks, there may come a point where a full-time staff member becomes necessary.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for a full-time offshore staff member to join your team, you should be searching for offshoring. For a lot of businesses, this is the next step after outsourcing.
