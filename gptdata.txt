HOW IT WORKS
How Our Recruitment Works
You submit a job description of what you are looking for.
The job description you create should include all duties for your new team member to perform in a bulleted list. Ideally, your tasks will not be too difficult and may be repetitive.
We start the search
Our candidate searches are conducted using at least 10 sources that include job sites, job advertisements, social media, referrals, and our own database of more than 25,000 potential candidates.
We filter and test worker candidates
Our high-tech filtering methods select candidates for you that we feel are most suitable for your role. We then can qualify these candidates using typing, English and aptitude tests that we’ve developed.
You interview qualifying candidates and select the one you like best.
Out of the pool of endorsed candidates that we present to you, you’re free to interview any or all of them to select the new team member you like best.
We onboard and they start working for you
Once you’ve selected the winning candidate, we’ll formalize their job offer and onboard them, and they’ll start working for you. We’ll be thoroughly involved in their first days of working for you, and our staff will be ready to address any obstacles or difficulties that they or you may encounter from those days going forward.

How Does Staff Management Work?
Be ready for day 1

Communication
ShoreAgents makes sure that team members communicate with clients as openly, honestly and often as possible to allow work to be executed efficiently, punctually and industriously.

What Standard Support Services Do We Provide?
Equipment
We provide a complete PC equipped with dual monitors, a webcam and a communications headset for all team members.
Management
Our staff functions as onsite managers, making sure the work gets done every hour, day and week. We make sure all issues, eventualities and emergencies are handled and dealt with as quickly and professionally as possible.
Performance
Our staff and support infrastructure measures worker performance so that goals can be reached and workers can be rewarded for extra effort.
HR and Legals
ShoreAgents handles all Human Resources support for your remote workers via a web-accessible HR hub, including panels for logged hours, employment contracts, leave requests, worker tardiness, etc. ShoreAgents also handles all legal aspects of worker employment.
Payroll
ShoreAgents takes care of payroll for your remote team members, including accounting for benefits and local charges, overtime/undertime, etc. All team members are given a standard bank debit card, so they can be paid. You’ll receive one simple invoice from ShoreAgents, and we’ll handle everything else.
IT Support
We have a full IT division that monitors and updates all hardware, software and network services.
Staff Engagement
We make sure your remote team members are kept happy and engaged, by celebrating work anniversaries and birthdays, providing activity clubs and monthly games, supplying free coffee and subsidized food and giving out monthly awards like employee of the month plus more.
Internet
We maintain high-speed Internet over multiple connections for all team members in our office.
Workstation
We provide a clean, fully outfitted workstation for every team member to work at.

Staff and Client Coaching
We will work with both your organization and your remote team members to make sure everyone is on the same page regarding work that needs to get done and tasks that need to be accomplished. It’s our goal to remove obstacles and reduce friction in the client-worker relationship to the greatest extent possible.
Advisory Services
Our staff can advise you and your organization about how to best leverage and integrate remote workers, given your business objectives and targets.

What Do You Need To Do To Use Our Services?
Task Allocation
The most important priority is for you to select tasks for your remote workers to perform. These tasks should be clearly defined and preferably not too complex (being repetitive is OK!).
Staff Training
You should determine who in your organization will train your remote team members. Ideally, they will have a deep understanding of what they will be training new team members on and may have trained other staff previously.
Manage KPI's
To get a good idea of how well your remote workers are performing, it’s recommended that you develop and observe key performance indicators (KPIs) you can use to measure success.

We Help Businesses of All Sizes Grow While Reducing Costs. What Does Your Business Need?
One Agent
Businesses that are small or new to outsourcing may want to start with just one agent. Getting comfortable with one agent will set you on the path to growth and potentially hiring additional team members further down the road.
Teams
Businesses that are growing and/or those that have some experience with one remote team member can add additional workers to build a team. Teams can support just one line of business, or several.
Workforce
Larger businesses and/or those that wish to deploy teams across multiple lines of business can build fully remote workforces using ShoreAgents.

Rules of Engagement
We can find you one, some but you can't have none.
We like our clients to be borderline obsessive-compulsive and be highly focused on growth.
It is a must that our clients have a sense of humor, as some mistakes are inevitable along the outsourcing journey — but these are always opportunities for learning.
RECRUITMENT
How Does it Work?
If you’d like to conduct a talent search with us, it’s really simple:
Fill out the Get Started Form
Submit your Job Description
Zoom Call with our team
Our support team will reach out to schedule a quick chat regarding the role you want to hire for.

The reason we do this is that every business is unique, and you’re the one who knows your business best. We’ve been at this long enough to know that a uniform approach doesn’t work for all firms; instead, we want to be 100 percent in-tune with what your needs are, so we can calibrate your expectations for success.

We organize our candidates into four well-defined groups, which are categorized as follows:
Exact Matches
An exact match is a candidate possessing all of the skills you’re looking for, who also has relevant experience and who is even familiar with many of your digital/online tools. These candidates are extremely rare to come across, but when we find them, we take the utmost measures to secure them for you. Keep in mind that candidates with the exact skills you need will typically be in high demand, so their cost will invariably be higher than average.
Transferable Skills
These candidates may not have worked in the exact industry niche your organization lies within, but they possess skills that are transferable. Most tasks that businesses have for remote workers tend to be fairly easy to perform and very teachable. These job candidates are quick learners and will typically get up to speed quickly, as they have previous experience in similar roles. Their cost will be slightly less than that of Exact Matches.
Entry Level
These candidates aren’t new to the workforce, but by the same token, they don’t come with a lot of experience. They’re minimally qualified for most tasks and will require some training to get up to a level where they’ll be useful for your team. Because they’re still getting their feet wet in terms of work experience, their skills and cost will be somewhere between candidates with Transferable Skills and Fresh Graduates.
Fresh Graduates
These candidates are absolutely new to the workforce. In most cases, they’re new university graduates who are extremely hungry to start working and learning. They tend to adapt to new jobs like ducks to water. We’ve had amazing success in placing these candidates, and their rise through the ranks to advanced positions continues to astonish us. The return on investment for firms that believe in these candidates is typically phenomenal. Even better, the cost of a fresh-graduate team member may be roughly half that of an Exact Match.

How Do We Attract Candidates?
We’re plugged into multiple job networks that allow us to select candidates from a diverse array of talented workers. We put more resources into locating worker candidates than we do into the marketing of our firm; after all, our business rests on your success, which, in turn, is enabled by our company delivering the most talented workers we can find.

We locate top talent via:
Our Database of 25,000+ Candidates
Facebook Ads
SMS Alerts
Our Own Referral System
LinkedIn Ads
Active Search
Job Sites
Google Ads
Jobs360
Facebook Groups
Electronic Direct Mail (EDM)
Between all of these sources, we attract more than 1,000 candidates per month. But out of this total, we only accept the top 5 percent of applicants. When we receive a new candidate’s application, we take care of all of the heavy lifting, so you don’t have to.

First, we verify all aspects of a candidate’s resumé to make sure they’re suitable for roles at our company.

Second, we conduct a phone screening with a candidate and allow them to evaluate themselves. We then assess them and grade them on:
Spoken English
Written English
Attitude
Qualifications
Goals
Job Knowledge
Computer Skills
Work History
Typing Speed

If we’re satisfied with these assessments, we’ll invite the candidate to a first-round interview conducted by our success team. We treat this as a formal interview, as it will be presented to you, the client. To save time, we ask many of the normal interview questions you might ask the candidate if you were conducting the interview yourself. Some of these questions will include:
What are your key strengths?
For cases where the client has very few or no tasks to assign to you, how will you handle this scenario?
What steps would you take if you didn’t completely understand a task?
Certain technical issues may arise while you’re working. How will you handle these?
How would you handle cases where the client is not easy to deal with or difficult to communicate with?
How long are you planning to stay with our company if you’re hired?

We welcome your testing of suitable candidates using any tools or methods you prefer. If you don’t have testing tools or methods for candidate evaluation, we’ve developed several of our own.

Our optional secondary filtration methods include the following tests:
Typing Test: Because a client’s tools are digital and online, a fast typing ability is crucial for worker candidates to possess. We can administer a typing test that measures both speed and accuracy.
English Testing: Our English test measures English-language speaking, reading and writing abilities. As English is the common denominator for all our clients, it’s critical that our workers be able to use it properly and be able to parse it accurately, whether it’s written or spoken.
Aptitude Testing: Our aptitude test was developed from more than 30 years’ worth of combined business experience, using business owners’ perspectives. This test allows clients to save time and see in advance how a worker candidate thinks and responds, and where their work ethic lies.

When these tests are administered, for quality purposes, every candidate is manually graded. Based on all the information we’ve gathered and the grading and assessments we’ve made, we endorse candidates we believe would be best suited for your position.

We present all endorsed candidates to you, along with their video introductions and interviews that we’ve already conducted with them. It’s up to you which candidates you would like to select for interviews with your company.

We’ll set up interviews for you with all your chosen candidates. We’ll assist you with these interviews, so we can listen in, help you with your final selection and give you feedback on your decision. But rest assured that the final selection is ultimately yours and yours alone.

Once you’ve made a choice, we’ll send a job offer with the agreed-upon salary to the candidate. Once the candidate accepts the offer, we’ll begin the onboarding process for the specified starting date. We’ll make sure all infrastructure and support programs are ready for the new team member’s first day, and at that point, our staff management takes over handling them.
HIRE ONE AGENT
Chapter 1: The Unique Approach to Recruiting a One-Agent Staff Member for Real Estate Businesses

Recruiting the right virtual staff member for your real estate business requires a unique approach, especially when it comes to hiring a one-agent staff member. At ShoreAgents, we specialize in providing remote staffing solutions to real estate businesses worldwide. In this chapter, we'll guide you through the recruitment process for hiring a one-agent staff member and help you find the right candidate from our pool of 25,000+ real estate-focused candidates.

Creating a Detailed Job Role: The Key to Successful Recruitment of One Agent Staff Members
The first step in recruiting a one-agent staff member is creating a detailed job role. This can be challenging, especially if you're new to the process. However, with the help of tools like Chatgpt, you can make it easier by recording all the necessary tasks and putting them into a formalized job role. When creating a job role, it's essential to document all the tasks your virtual staff member can complete offshore. These are typically tasks that are completed online or over the phone. It's also important to itemize the tasks in a way that's easy to understand and learn for your new staff member.

Understanding the Importance of Detailed Task Documentation and Training Materials for One Agent Recruitment.
As a smaller business, you may have many tasks that could be completed, and the roles could be more diverse. This means that you need to have a larger scope of knowledge across the whole business. Therefore, it's crucial to mark down the difficulty of each task, whether it's easy, medium, or hard, and whether you have any official process for it. When working with a staff member in the Philippines, you need to have training material, process material, and procedures for each of the tasks that they're going to be completing. So it's best to have all these things ready before you even start the recruitment process.

Finding the Right Candidate: Navigating ShoreAgents' Screening and Interview Process
Once you have the job role and tasks documented, it's time to create a work order and look for the right candidate. At ShoreAgents, we are always hiring for similar jobs and have a large database of 25,000+ candidates. There may already be someone suitable for your job in our pool. However, we also advertise across multiple platforms to ensure we attract the right candidate. Once we attract candidates, we filter and test all of them for you. We run them through some basic screening, and if they pass and we think they'll be suitable for your job role, we'll offer them a company interview.

The Unique Company Interview Process for Hiring One Agent Staff Members at ShoreAgents
Our company interview process is unique and saves you time. It's conducted by our success team, and we record it for you to review. This way, you can quickly see who you want to formally interview. It's especially useful when hiring someone for an on-the-phone role, as you'll hear how they speak and communicate. We then endorse a group of candidates to you who we think are suitable for the role, and you make your decision of who to interview.

Finalizing the Hiring Process for Your One Agent Virtual Staff Member
Once you've conducted the interviews and selected the right candidate, our team will reach out to them and book a zoom call with you, the candidate, and whoever needs to be on the call from your business. This call is your opportunity to ask any questions you need to ensure they're a good fit for your company. Once you've made your decision, we offer the candidate the job, and once they accept, they'll start working for you.

The Key to Successful Recruitment: Finding the Right Fit for Your Real Estate Business with ShoreAgents.
In conclusion, recruiting a one-agent staff member requires a unique approach that focuses on finding the right fit for your real estate business. Creating a detailed job role, documenting all necessary tasks, and using our unique company interview process are the keys to successful recruitment. With the help of ShoreAgents, you can easily find the right candidate for your one-agent staff member role and ensure they'll fit seamlessly into your business.

Chapter 2: Training and Onboarding: Things to Consider After Accepting Your New One Agent Staff Member
Preparing for Your One Agent Staff Member's Start Date: Software and Communication Tools
Congratulations on selecting your new one-agent staff member! Now that you have accepted the candidate and signed the job offer, it's essential to prepare for their start date to ensure a smooth onboarding experience.

One of the most critical things to consider is the software and communication tools the staff member will be using within your business. It's important to make sure you have all the necessary logins and access prepared, and we recommend creating a company email for the staff member to use for all communications and logins.

Establishing Efficient Task Management Processes for Your One Agent Staff Member

Another consideration is how tasks will move from your internal team to your external one agent staff member. Do you have any productivity software in place to manage and delegate tasks? It's crucial to establish clear processes for task management to ensure efficiency and accountability.

Creating a Training Plan for Your New One Agent Staff Member: A Key Element for Successful Onboarding
Additionally, it's important to have a training plan in place for your new staff member. This includes providing them with all necessary training materials, scheduling training sessions, and assigning a point of contact for them to ask questions and receive support during their onboarding process.

Establishing Clear Communication Channels and Expectations with Your New One Agent Staff Member

Finally, make sure to establish clear communication channels and expectations with your new staff member. Will you be having regular check-ins or team meetings? How often will you be communicating with them? These are all crucial elements to consider when onboarding a new one agent staff member to ensure their success in your business.

Chapter 3: Communication and Productivity Tools for Success

When it comes to managing a one-agent staff member, communication and productivity tools are crucial for success. In this chapter, we will dive deeper into the importance of these tools and how they can benefit your business.

Enhancing Productivity with Task Management Software for Virtual Teams

Productivity software such as Clickup, Asana, Basecamp, Airtable, and Trello are specifically designed to help manage and delegate tasks efficiently. These tools make it easy to track progress, assign tasks, and communicate with your staff member. With numerous options available, it's important to research and find a tool that works best for your business needs.

The good thing about productivity software is that they are designed for remote work and make life very easy. They allow you to easily pass tasks between your team and your virtual staff member. Whether you use Google, Outlook, or Teams, the system should be easy to use and accessible to all team members involved in the project.

Effective Communication Platforms for Managing a Virtual Staff Member
Clear communication channels are critical when managing a virtual staff member. Establishing an efficient communication platform that allows you to communicate effectively is important. Popular options include WhatsApp, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet. It's important to select a platform that works best for your business and meets your specific communication needs.

The communication platform you choose will also play a crucial role in conducting training and communicating with your staff member. If your staff member will be on the telephone, you need to have a VoIP system set up. This will enable them to communicate effectively with other members of your team and customers.

Benefits of Productivity and Communication Tools in Virtual Staff Management
The advantages of productivity and communication tools are numerous. They make it easy to collaborate with your virtual staff member, share files, track progress, and delegate tasks. Additionally, they allow you to communicate with your staff member in real-time, making it easy to ask questions and provide feedback.

Maximizing Efficiency: Strategies for Effective Use of Productivity and Communication Tools
Using Productivity and Communication Tools Effectively
To use these tools effectively, it's important to establish clear processes for task management and communication. Set clear expectations for the use of the tools and provide training to your staff member. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page and knows how to use the tools effectively.

The Importance of Productivity and Communication Tools in Managing a One Agent Staff Member
In conclusion, productivity and communication tools are essential for the successful management of a one agent staff member. By selecting the right tools and establishing clear processes, you can ensure a seamless workflow and effective collaboration with your virtual staff member.

Chapter 4: Creating a Training Plan and Documenting Procedures for Virtual Staff Members
Once you have selected your virtual staff member, established clear communication channels, and implemented productivity tools, the next step is to create a training plan and document procedures. This will ensure that your staff member is equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to perform their job effectively.

Chapter 5: How We Together Manage Your One Agent Team Member
Once you've selected your one agent team member and established a clear communication channel with them, the next step is to manage them effectively. Managing a remote worker can be challenging, especially when they are located on the other side of the world. This is where ShoreAgents comes in with a three-tiered approach to managing your remote team member's performance and relationship with your organization.

Maximizing Performance with Performance Reviews for Your Remote Staff
ShoreAgents believes that no one is better suited to comment on your staff member's performance than you. As their direct manager, you'll be the one administering the work and conducting training daily. We rely on you to take responsibility for these tasks. To provide critical feedback, we'll reach out to you in interviews held during the first, third, and fifth months following your hire(s) and annually thereafter.

During these reviews, we'll obtain feedback related to your staff member's quality of work, desire to improve, job knowledge, communication, teamwork, time management, reliability, and overall attendance. We'll assess the feedback received for each team member individually and take necessary actions, including meeting with you and the team member if needed, to help you avoid any negative consequences for your business. If appropriate, we can implement training plans to help your staff improve and explore new areas.

Catch-Ups for Effective Remote Staff Management
Catch-ups with your remote workers are undertaken monthly by our success team to obtain feedback about how they're handling working with you and your internal staff. We'll shoulder this responsibility, as there may be information they're more comfortable sharing privately with us. We'll use this information to help your staff improve in areas they may be struggling with or are eager to learn more about. Once we receive this worker feedback, we'll conduct a one-on-one session with each team member to discuss the results in detail.

The Importance of Check-Ins in Managing Remote Staff Members
During the early days of your staff member's engagement, we'll check-in weekly to ensure they're fitting into their roles and the office environment. A successful start is essential for every new team member, and check-ins help us identify critical areas where additional workers can offer the most assistance and value. With every check-in, our success team will assess the ongoing work and worker performance levels and provide feedback to you and your team. These check-ins will be conducted regularly every week until you feel they're no longer needed and/or your team member is settled in and performing to the best of their ability.

Managing Remote Workers Made Easy with ShoreAgents' Three-Tiered Approach
Managing a remote worker can be a daunting task, but with the help of ShoreAgents, we can ensure that your staff member is performing to their best ability. Our three-tiered approach to staff management is essential for your remote working success. With regular performance reviews, catch-ups, and check-ins, we can ensure that your remote team member is well-managed and performing their job to the best of their ability.

BUILD A TEAM
Chapter 1: Introduction
So you want to build a team with ShoreAgents? Congratulations on taking this significant step towards optimizing your business operations! We're excited to potentially have you on board. As a leading outsourcing provider, we understand the unique requirements and challenges of assembling and managing a remote team, and we're here to help you every step of the way.

Building a team versus hiring one agent can indeed be a different experience, but with the right guidance and support, it can be a rewarding and transformative decision for your business. A well-built team can help you scale your operations, increase efficiency, and maintain a high level of quality across various tasks and projects.

In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the entire process of building a remote team with ShoreAgents. We'll delve into crucial topics such as recruitment and how to find the best talent, onboarding and training to ensure a smooth start for your team members, account management and ongoing support to facilitate a productive work environment, and overcoming the challenges related to managing a remote team, including cultural differences and communication barriers.

By the end of this guide, you will have a solid understanding of the process, benefits, and best practices for building and managing a remote team with ShoreAgents. Whether you're new to outsourcing or looking to expand your existing remote workforce, this guide will provide you with valuable insights and practical advice to help you make the most of your investment in remote team building.

Chapter 2: Building a Team vs. Hiring One Agent
In this chapter, we will explore the differences between building a team and hiring a single agent, as well as the advantages and challenges of each approach. Understanding these differences will help you make informed decisions about how to structure your remote workforce and ensure the best possible outcomes for your business.

Building a team can indeed present its challenges, such as coordinating multiple people, ensuring effective communication, and managing potential conflicts. However, when set up correctly, a well-structured team can become a more efficient and powerful asset for your business.

The team approach is generally more suitable for mid-sized businesses that can benefit from having more specialized roles, allowing each team member to focus on their specific area of expertise. This results in a more efficient division of labor and higher overall performance, as opposed to having one person juggling multiple tasks with varying levels of proficiency.

When building a team, you will need to consider the following factors:
Define clear roles and responsibilities: Ensure that each team member has a well-defined role and a clear understanding of their responsibilities. This will help avoid confusion, duplication of efforts, and potential conflicts among team members.
Establish a strong team leader: Appoint a capable team leader who can act as the primary point of contact, manage the team's performance, and facilitate communication between the team and the rest of the organization.
Implement effective communication and collaboration tools: Choose the right tools and platforms that enable seamless communication and collaboration among team members, such as project management software, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools.
Create a supportive work environment: Foster a positive and inclusive work culture that encourages teamwork, open communication, and mutual respect. This will help create a strong sense of belonging and loyalty among team members, which is essential for a successful remote team.
On the other hand, hiring a single agent can be a more straightforward process, especially for small businesses or those just starting with outsourcing. While a single agent may be able to handle multiple tasks, their effectiveness may be limited by their skill set and capacity, potentially affecting the quality and efficiency of their work.

In conclusion, the decision to build a team or hire a single agent depends on the size and needs of your business, as well as your long-term goals and vision. By carefully considering these factors and following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can build a remote workforce that drives your business forward and contributes to its success.

Chapter 6: Identifying and Developing a Team Leader
Selecting the right team leader is essential for fostering a cohesive, high-performing remote team. In this chapter, we'll discuss the importance of identifying and developing a team leader, as well as the qualities to look for and how to empower them to effectively manage your team.
Importance of a Team Leader: A team leader serves as the bridge between you and your remote team. They are responsible for coordinating team activities, overseeing daily operations, and ensuring that everyone is working towards a common goal. A strong team leader can alleviate much of the stress associated with managing multiple team members, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your business.
Qualities to Look For: When identifying a potential team leader, consider their communication skills, problem-solving abilities, adaptability, and capacity to motivate and inspire their team members. The ideal candidate should possess a strong work ethic, be proactive, and have a solid understanding of your business and its objectives.
Promoting from Within: It's crucial to promote a team leader from within your existing team, rather than bringing in someone from the outside. This approach ensures that the chosen individual has a deep understanding of the team's dynamics, work processes, and company culture. Promoting from within also demonstrates your commitment to recognizing and rewarding hard work and dedication, leading to increased morale and loyalty among your team members.
Providing Support and Training: Once you've identified a team leader, it's essential to provide them with the necessary support and training to succeed in their new role. This may include leadership training, ongoing mentorship, and access to resources that will help them develop their skills and manage the team effectively.
Empowering Your Team Leader: Empower your team leader by granting them the autonomy to make decisions and manage the team's daily operations. Trusting them to handle these responsibilities will not only boost their confidence but also improve their ability to lead the team effectively.
Regular Check-ins and Feedback: Maintain an open line of communication with your team leader, conducting regular check-ins to discuss their progress and address any concerns they may have. Provide constructive feedback and guidance to help them grow in their role and continue to enhance their leadership abilities.
In summary, identifying and developing a team leader is a critical aspect of building a successful remote team. By selecting a capable and committed individual, providing them with the necessary support and training, and empowering them to lead, you can create a strong foundation for your team's growth and long-term success.

Chapter 7: Overcoming Cultural Challenges
Working with a remote team often means dealing with cultural differences that can impact communication, work style, and overall team dynamics. In this chapter, we'll explore some common cultural challenges you may encounter and provide guidance on how to overcome them with the help of our success team.
Communication Styles: Different cultures may have unique ways of expressing themselves, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. It's essential to establish clear communication channels and promote open dialogue to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Encourage your team members to ask questions and share their thoughts, and be mindful of potential language barriers or nuances in communication.
Work Ethic and Time Management: Different cultures may have varying expectations regarding work hours, punctuality, and work-life balance. Establishing clear expectations from the outset can help mitigate any potential issues. Be flexible when possible and strive to create a work environment that respects and accommodates the diverse needs of your team members.
Decision-Making and Problem-Solving: Cultural differences can also influence decision-making and problem-solving approaches. Ensure that your team members understand the expectations surrounding these processes and provide guidance as needed. Encourage collaboration and the sharing of ideas, fostering an environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing their perspective.
Building Trust and Rapport: Establishing trust and rapport among team members with diverse cultural backgrounds can take time and effort. Organize team-building activities and promote open communication to help bridge cultural gaps and foster a strong sense of camaraderie.

Chapter 9: Ensuring Redundancy and Scalability
In this chapter, we will discuss the importance of redundancy and scalability when building a team with ShoreAgents, as well as strategies to achieve them. Having a well-structured team ensures that your business remains operational and can grow seamlessly, even if one team member is unavailable or if your workload increases.
Cross-training and Skill Development: To ensure redundancy, it's crucial to cross-train team members in multiple tasks and responsibilities. This enables them to cover for each other during absences or emergencies. Encourage skill development and knowledge sharing among team members to create a versatile workforce capable of stepping in whenever needed.
Documentation and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Developing comprehensive documentation and SOPs for your team's tasks and processes is vital. This ensures that any team member can quickly understand and execute tasks, even if they are not their primary responsibility. Regularly update these documents to keep them relevant and useful.
Backup Plans and Contingency Strategies: Establish backup plans and contingency strategies for critical tasks and roles. For example, designate backup team leaders or key personnel who can step in during emergencies or absences. This will help maintain continuity and reduce the impact of unforeseen events on your business operations.
Scalable Team Structure: Design your team structure to be scalable, allowing you to add or reassign team members as your business grows or your needs change. This might involve creating specialized sub-teams or implementing a flexible organizational hierarchy that can be easily adjusted.
Regular Performance Reviews and Team Assessments: Conduct regular performance reviews and team assessments to identify areas for improvement and potential bottlenecks. By addressing these issues proactively, you can ensure that your team remains agile and can adapt to changing circumstances.
Effective Communication and Collaboration: Foster a culture of open communication and collaboration within your team. This will encourage team members to support each other and share their knowledge and expertise, contributing to redundancy and scalability.
Leveraging Technology: Utilize productivity and communication tools to streamline workflows and enhance collaboration. These tools can help your team stay organized and connected, allowing for seamless coordination and the ability to scale up or down as needed.

CREATE A WORKFORCE
Chapter 1: Understanding Workforce with ShoreAgents
At ShoreAgents, we define a workforce as a group of staff members numbering six or more. Our specific service guide is designed to meet the unique requirements that come with building a larger workforce, as opposed to forming a smaller team or hiring a single agent. This guide will help you understand how to effectively structure and manage your workforce with us.

The first step towards building a workforce with ShoreAgents is a clear understanding of your internal team structure. This is crucial because when establishing a workforce in the Philippines, different teams or groups of team members are required to specialize in various sectors. Let's consider an example.

Suppose you run a property development business, and you plan to outsource certain operations, like your finance department, contract administration, property marketing, and general back-office tasks. In that case, you would require distinct teams for each area. This could mean needing three contract administrators, five staff members for your finance department, five for basic admin support, six for property marketing, and perhaps a few drafters.

It's crucial that you identify team leaders within your organization who will be responsible for managing these divisions in the Philippines. They will serve as your primary points of contact and will be responsible for maintaining smooth operations.

Remember, building a workforce isn't just about hiring a group of people to complete tasks. It's about creating a well-structured, efficient, and collaborative system that ensures your business runs smoothly. By taking the time to understand what a workforce really means and how it applies to your business, you're already on your way to building a successful team with ShoreAgents.

In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into how you can evaluate your current team structure and how to adapt it for your workforce in the Philippines. Continue reading to learn more!

Chapter 2: Evaluating Your Team Structure
Once you have a solid understanding of what building a workforce with ShoreAgents entails, the next step is to evaluate your internal team structure. This is a crucial process that will shape your offshore team and determine its efficiency and effectiveness.

The goal is to create a structure that complements your existing operations and maximizes the capabilities of your offshore team. This involves understanding the roles you need to fill, the number of individuals required for each role, and who will manage each team.

If you operate a property development business and plan to outsource various functions, for example, you need to determine how many individuals you require in each department. This could be three contract administrators, five in finance, five in basic administration, six in property marketing, and perhaps a few drafters. This assessment helps you understand the scale of your offshore team.

Next, identify team leaders within your organization who will oversee these divisions in the Philippines. These leaders should be capable of managing the team, understanding their needs, and ensuring their performance aligns with your company's goals. These team leaders will act as the bridge between your local and offshore teams, ensuring a seamless flow of communication and effective coordination.

It's crucial to remember that your offshore team's structure should mirror your organization's culture and values. Ensure that the roles, responsibilities, and hierarchy align with your business ethos and are designed to promote collaboration and productivity.

Evaluating your internal team structure is not a one-time process but should be an ongoing activity. As your business grows and evolves, your team structure should also adapt to accommodate new roles, increased workload, and operational changes.

In the next chapter, we will delve deeper into how to structure your offshore team in the Philippines, focusing on how to choose leaders and foster growth. 

Chapter 3: Structuring Your Offshore Team
After evaluating your team structure, the next step is to form the structure of your offshore team in the Philippines. Here, you need to designate leaders who will manage your on-site team, ensuring smooth operation and communication between your local and offshore teams.

The process of forming your offshore team is not an overnight task but a gradual process. It's recommended to build your team from the ground up, focusing initially on hiring the right individuals who can evolve into team leaders. This approach has two benefits. 

Firstly, these individuals get to understand the nuances of your business from the start, and secondly, they grow along with the team, giving them an in-depth understanding of your offshore operations.

Let's look at the process more closely. Start by hiring individuals for the key roles in your offshore team, ensuring they possess the necessary skills and aptitude for the job. Once these individuals are in place, identify the ones who show leadership potential. These could be individuals who excel in their tasks, show a knack for problem-solving, and have the ability to inspire their colleagues. 

Promote these individuals to leadership roles, giving them the responsibility to manage their respective teams.

Another critical aspect of structuring your offshore team is establishing a strong line of communication between the team leaders and your local team. Regular meetings, updates, and performance reports should be standard practices, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

Lastly, keep in mind that your offshore team structure should not be rigid. As your business grows and evolves, you may need to tweak your team structure, add new roles, or even create new teams. This adaptability is key to maintaining an efficient and productive offshore team.

In the next chapter, we will guide you through the hiring process with ShoreAgents, providing insights into how we find and filter the right talent for your team. 

Chapter 4: Hiring Process with ShoreAgents
Now that you have a clear understanding of your team structure and the roles you need to fill, the next step is hiring the right people. At ShoreAgents, we strive to make the hiring process as efficient and effective as possible. Let's look at how we do it.

Firstly, we submit work orders for each job role you provide. These orders outline the skills, experience, and qualifications required for each position. With these specifications in mind, we then search the market for suitable candidates. With our extensive database of 25,000 candidates specializing in real estate roles, we have a rich pool of talent to draw from.

Next, we conduct a thorough screening process. This begins with arranging interviews with candidates who pass our initial suitability assessment and required tests. Our success team conducts a one-on-one company interview with each candidate over Zoom, recording the call for your review. This not only saves you time but also allows you to make informed decisions.

Once the interviews are complete, we provide you with the candidates' resumes, test results, and interview recordings. You can review this information at your convenience and select candidates for a final interview. We then schedule Zoom calls at a time that suits your team members, allowing them to conduct the final interviews. This is your chance to ask role-specific questions and assess if the candidates are a good fit for your company.

Upon your satisfaction with the candidates, you notify us of your hiring decisions. We take it from there, sending out job offers and arranging start dates for each new team member.

At ShoreAgents, we strive to streamline the hiring process, ensuring you get the right talent for your team without the usual hassles and time-consuming processes of traditional recruitment.

In the next chapter, we will discuss onboarding and training, providing you with insights on how to ensure a smooth start for your new team members. 

Chapter 5: Onboarding and Training with ShoreAgents
Once you have selected your new team members, the next step is onboarding and training. This phase is critical as it sets the stage for how your new employees will integrate into your organization and their specific roles. With ShoreAgents, we aim to make this process as seamless as possible.

The first part of the onboarding process involves setting start dates for your new hires. It's a good practice to have employees in similar roles start on the same day. This facilitates group training and allows team members to form bonds from the outset, which can enhance team cohesion.

Before your workforce starts, consider the tools and software they will need to effectively carry out their tasks. Ensure they have the necessary access to these resources from day one. This could involve anything from specific project management software to access to certain company databases or platforms.

Alongside this, a comprehensive training plan is vital to guide their role for the first month, three months, and beyond. This should cover all tasks they will be responsible for and any company-specific processes or protocols they need to follow. Remember, it's your responsibility to train staff members on their assigned tasks within your business.

Regarding onboarding, ShoreAgents schedules a separate call with you or the relevant person in your business to ensure readiness. We onboard the staff members, ensuring they have everything they need and are prepared for their first day. Our team will introduce you to your dedicated account manager, who will coordinate with your team for day-one planning and other requirements.

The goal of onboarding and training is not only to familiarize your new hires with their roles but also to make them feel part of your organization. A well-structured onboarding process can boost employee engagement, productivity, and retention, so it's worth investing the time and resources to get it right.

In the next chapter, we will delve into managing your offshore team, providing you with insights into effective communication, performance monitoring, and engagement strategies. 

Chapter 6: Managing Your Offshore Team
Successfully managing an offshore team can seem daunting. However, with clear communication, effective performance monitoring, and strong engagement strategies, you can ensure that your offshore team is as productive and cohesive as your local team.

Project management software is crucial when it comes to managing a large team. Tools like ClickUp, Airtable, Monday, and SANA offer a range of features that allow you to track tasks, deadlines, and the overall performance of your staff. By implementing such software, you can monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and manage workload distribution effectively.

Communication is another vital aspect of team management. Clear, consistent, and open communication ensures that your offshore team fully understands their responsibilities, is aware of any changes or updates, and feels comfortable voicing any concerns or suggestions. 

Reliable platforms such as Slack or WhatsApp can facilitate smooth and efficient communication within your workforce. Remember, regular team meetings and one-on-one sessions with team members can also enhance communication and build stronger relationships.

ShoreAgents also provides support for staff management. We adopt a three-tiered approach that includes regular check-ins, monthly catch-up sessions, and performance reviews. Regular check-ins, especially in the initial months, allow us to provide feedback and support to new team members. Monthly catch-up sessions enable us to address any issues and maintain open lines of communication. 

Performance reviews, conducted in the first, third, and fifth months, determine whether a staff member will become a regular employee, as per the labor laws in the Philippines.
In addition to performance management, employee engagement is paramount. 

ShoreAgents prioritizes creating a productive and happy workplace environment, organizing various activities and events to celebrate holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, and outstanding performance. We encourage you to also implement your own initiatives to foster a sense of belonging and alignment with your company culture.

In the next chapter, we will talk about the physical workspace, detailing how ShoreAgents provides a conducive environment for your offshore team. 

Chapter 7: Physical Workspace for Your Offshore Team
In an offshore work environment, the physical workspace your team operates in can play a crucial role in their productivity, engagement, and overall job satisfaction. ShoreAgents understands the importance of creating a suitable work environment for your offshore team, and we have various strategies in place to support this.

Firstly, we offer private workspaces for your team. These workspaces are designed to provide a conducive environment for your employees, fostering productivity and efficiency. Importantly, these workspaces can be customized to reflect your branding, establishing a sense of your own office for your offshore team. This not only enhances a feeling of professionalism and commitment but also reinforces your team's connection to your business.

As your workforce expands, we provide discounts to reflect the economies of scale achieved. This means you can continue to provide a high-quality work environment for your growing team, without the costs spiraling out of control.


Apart from the physical environment, we also provide a ticketing system for both clients and staff members. This system allows you to request tasks or catch up with the success team. Similarly, your staff members can use it to report any issues or request equipment upgrades. By doing so, we ensure that your team has the tools they need to perform their roles effectively and that any issues are promptly addressed.

To navigate the challenges that may arise in managing an offshore team, especially those related to cultural differences, ShoreAgents provides dedicated support. Think of our success team as your dedicated concierge service, there to guide you through the process and ensure a smooth experience.
In the final chapter, we will discuss how to tackle challenges you may face while building your offshore team and how ShoreAgents assists in overcoming these hurdles. 

Chapter 8: Overcoming Challenges in Building Your Offshore Team

Building and managing a large offshore team can come with its unique set of challenges. Cultural differences, language barriers, and time zone disparities can impact various aspects of your team's functioning. However, with a strategic approach and the right support, these challenges can be navigated effectively.

At ShoreAgents, we have successfully helped many companies build their workforces in the Philippines, guiding them through potential obstacles and providing solutions. Here are some common challenges and how we address them:

Cultural Differences: Differences in work culture and social norms can impact communication, negotiation, and overall team dynamics. Our success team has an in-depth understanding of both Western and Filipino cultures and is well-equipped to bridge this gap. We assist you in navigating sensitive topics such as discussing salaries and performance, ensuring that all communication respects and takes into account cultural nuances.
Language Barriers: Although English is widely spoken in the Philippines, there may be times when language barriers pose a challenge. To mitigate this, we ensure all our candidates have a strong proficiency in English and are comfortable in a global work environment.
Time Zone Disparities: Different time zones can impact collaboration and communication within the team. However, the flexibility and willingness of the Filipino workforce to adapt to different work schedules can significantly help in overcoming this challenge.
Performance Management: Managing performance from afar can be a challenge. Our three-tiered approach to staff management, which includes regular check-ins, monthly catch-up sessions, and performance reviews, ensures that performance standards are met and any issues are promptly addressed.
Engagement and Integration: Building a sense of belonging and connection with your company can be more challenging with an offshore team. To tackle this, ShoreAgents organizes various activities and events for your team. We encourage you to implement your own initiatives to further foster integration and alignment with your company culture.

Building an offshore team is a journey, one that can lead to immense growth and success for your company. While there may be hurdles along the way, with ShoreAgents by your side, you'll be well-equipped to overcome them.

STAFF MANAGEMENT
A Three-Tiered Approach
When you manage employees locally, you’re 100 percent in control. However, when your staff is located on the other side of the world, it can present minor challenges. But don’t worry; we have you covered.

ShoreAgents has a three-tiered approach — via Performance Reviews, Catch-Ups and Check-Ins — to managing the performance and relationship you have with your remote team members. Acquiring feedback from all parties and points of view is vital to your team’s success. We obtain feedback from you, your organization, your remote staff members and our own staff investigations.

Performance Reviews
No one is as fit to comment on the performance of your staff as you. After all, you’ll be the one administering the work and conducting worker training daily; we rely on you to take responsibility for these tasks. We’ll reach out to you in interviews held during the first, third and fifth months following your hire(s) (and annually thereafter) to provide critical feedback.

Feedback will specifically be related to a team member’s:
Quality of work
Desire to improve
Job knowledge
Communication
Teamwork
Time management
Reliability
Overall attendance

When we receive this feedback, we’ll assess the comments for each worker individually and take actions as necessary (including meeting with you and the individual team member) to help you avoid any future pain or negative consequences for your business. If it’s appropriate, we can implement training plans to help your staff improve in and explore new areas.

Catch-Ups
Catch-Ups with your remote workers are undertaken monthly by our success team. We do this to get feedback from them about how they’re handling working with you and your internal staff. We believe in shouldering this responsibility, as there may be information they’re more comfortable sharing privately with us. We use this information to help them improve in areas they may be struggling with or are eager to learn more about. They may even have suggestions that would help you and your business.

Once we receive this worker feedback, we’ll conduct a one-on-one session with each team member to discuss the results in detail. We’ll put together a monthly action plan and then extend an opportunity for you to have a discussion with us about our findings. This will tell you how the satisfaction level of your team members (rated as “happy,” “satisfied” or “unhappy”) relates to their tasks and work environment.

Check-Ins
During the early days of your new staff engagements, we’ll check in weekly to ensure your hires are fitting into their roles and the office environment. A successful start is essential for every new team member, and Check-Ins help us to identify critical areas of your business where we believe additional workers can offer the most assistance and value. With every Check-In, our success team will assess the ongoing work and worker performance levels and provide feedback to you and your team.

These Check-Ins will be conducted regularly every week until you feel they’re no longer needed and/or your team member is settled in and performing to the best of their ability. If, at any point during your worker’s engagement, you or your organization feels the need for such Check-Ins to resume, simply let us know, and we’ll re-institute them until you advise us to do otherwise.

This three-tiered approach to staff management is extremely important for your remote working success.

Staff Engagement
Keeping your staff happy in their work setting is one of our top priorities, and we excel at it. All our engagements are geared toward encouraging performance for clients and making team members’ work environments great places to be, so they can attract your next superstar team members.
Day 1
From the day your new staff members start, we’ll have already engaged them on your behalf to ensure their happiness and excitement for their new jobs remain robust. And it doesn’t stop there.

Employee of the Month
We have a unique scoring system covering multiple areas that selects an Employee of the Month every month. A team member can only achieve this prestigious distinction by blowing your expectations for them out of the water. We have micro prizes for each job area to encourage all team members to excel and other awards to encourage the entire team.

Work Anniversary
Celebrating life events is an established tradition in the Philippines, and work anniversaries are among the most important of these. Commemorating these events with showers of gifts and praise for your workers ensures a long tenure for your team as they celebrate each passing year; we encourage you to join in and help make these festivities special.

Monthly Activities
Monthly fun and games make commuting to our office worthwhile for your workers. These games are carefully selected to fit culturally and amuse them; we understand your team members and what pleases them.

Birthdays
We never miss a birthday, as birthdays are important and memorable occasions in the Philippines. Birthdays are occasions when workers can talk informally with their colleagues and get to know them better. The more friends your team members make at work, the more likely they’ll be to stay at their job.

Clubs
ShoreAgents maintains several different activity clubs for team members to enjoy doing things they love after work. Some of these include the Shore Book Club, the Shore Photography Club, the Shore Music Club and the Shore Fitness Club.

Endless Free Coffee and Subsidized Food

Free coffee and subsidized food are provided to team members so they’ll have no shortage of energy and motivation.

Free Shuttles
All of the above elements will ensure that your team members are 100 percent satisfied; however, we don’t stop there — we’ll also consult with you on additional means you can employ to maintain a successful working relationship with your workers.

Introducing the Success Team
Our success team is always on call to help you through the outsourcing journey, and we’ll guide you from the moment you select your first new workers to the period when they’re fully engaged with your organization. You’ll always have direct access to our team of experts for literally anything you need support with.

We use a ticketing system for support and purchasing for you and your staff. If you need any help with your workers, simply submit a ticket, and our team will respond immediately. Likewise, if your workers have any concerns, they also can submit a ticket, and we’ll respond to it instantly. These systems are part of our standard operating services, and they come at no additional charge.

Managing Director
Working Since 2013 to Make Outsourcing Better

We will make it work

I am not sure how I ended up just up and leaving Australia to move over the Philippines to build and run a BPO for Real Estate. I am pretty sure it was a big accident, but somehow it was meant to be. I have loved Real Estate since the day I got my first listing at just 18; it was like a drug. Hence I fell into owning my own Real Estate business and then started the journey of outsourcing to take it to the next level.

Implementing an Offshore team was hard work and I made many mistakes; however, I eventually got it all to work. I was always passionate about helping other Real Estate Business owners getting outsourcing set up, so maybe it was not an accident, and it was fate not that I believe much in that.

Today I could not be happier as I get to do what I love the most, talk Real Estate, help other business owners thrive and grow a big business of my own while I am at it. If you would ever like to chat, feel free to reach out.

2005
The Start of my Real Estate Journey
I got into Real Estate back when I was 18 at the very end of 2005. I used to be a personal trainer at the time, and I trained the principal of Metrocity Realty, Greg Jackson. He was impressed with my hunger and grit, as that was how I got him into the Gym in the first place. He stuck me in Sales from day one, and this is where I learned the Hussle and got my first listing, and made my first sale! Greg was a great mentor and taught me to save and invest in property. I saved up in the time I was at Metro to buy my first home and additionally an investment property.

2008
Back in the game with loads of life experience
I took six months off work and went on a traveling adventure to get some life experience under my belt. I returned to Aus. and wanted to work closer to where I lived and grew up. So I started working at Ray White in Mt Gravatt. I listed a property on my first day and sold the property the following weekend. I got the hang of it and started to brand myself! I made rookie of the year and grossed 260k in commission. I began to think of this Real Estate Game as a real career and wanted to give it now 100% of my attention.

2010
Dipping the toe into running my own show
I decided to make a move to Re/max and become a contractor so I could keep a bit more commission in my pocket. There was a lot more flexibility at Re/max, and I made listing and selling my obsession. My personal brand developed, and my sales went through the roof, achieving the number one agent status in the office for most of the calendar months. My best months had me sitting in the top 5 in QLD, Number 6 in Aus, and achieving an award that I had to go pick up in Las Vegas. I hired a PA and started to think that running my own show was for me!
 
2012
The real deal, my own Real Estate Business!
I took the plunge and thought to stuff it, I am just going to do it! I loved starting my own brand and going through all the emotions that go with it. The ups, downs, and challenges were not on my plate when I was just worried about listing and selling. Sales kept pumping, and I developed the company as a real competitor in the market. I now turned my focus on building a team and creating the process I needed to go next level. Next on the agenda was establishing a rent role, and this is where I first started to utilize Offshore staff to grow, and that is certainly what we did.

2015
Big Business! Beyond Compare™
My business was growing. However, we were known to sell cheap properties and lost out to some of the more well-known brands. I decided to strip it back and rebrand while purchasing another office to add to our two. We went big with the brand, and it got us in more doors, and we saturated the market! The rent roll grew, our team grew, and I decided to eventually sell out and let someone take over while I eye off my next business challenges to overcome!

Outsourcing Experience
There are two sides of the coin when it comes to outsourcing. The customer side and the BPO side and I have huge experience in both.

CUSTOMER SIDE - FRUSTRATION
As a customer, I have used many different service providers to find staff and house them for our company. I found it very frustrating dealing with a provider that did not understand the Real Estate Game and what team members I required. I ended up having to create my own whole system anyways. Instead of getting frustrated, I got fascinated and started to develop my own unique strategies to make outsourcing work.

SERVICE PROVIDER - SOLUTION
Being on the customer side helped me develop the ultimate solution on the service provider side. All the issues I faced before as a customer, we have ironed out to make a far superior solution. We build a talent pool of pre educated staff that understand the real estate game and what is required. The right start makes for a smooth journey and an increased speed of implementation.

Frequently Asked Questions
OUTSOURCING
What is outsourcing?
Outsourcing is delegating certain tasks to specific functions that may not be the company’s core focus. This involves hiring external professionals from a specialized agency to handle various tasks and responsibilities. ShoreAgents is a real estate outsourcing agency that acts as an intermediary connecting real estate businesses with qualified candidates.

Why should you outsource?
Outsourcing offers several advantages for your business. Primarily, you can focus on your business’s core competencies while reducing operational costs. Not to mention your overall productivity and operations will significantly increase.

Particularly if you outsource through a real estate staffing solution agency like ShoreAgents, you can skip the tedious recruitment process which can lead to a more efficient and thorough search for the best candidates for your firm.

Why should you outsource in the Philippines?
The Philippines provides an excellent combination of a highly skilled workforce and lower labor costs compared to Western countries. The country’s strong presence in the BPO industry also makes it an attractive deal for several businesses looking to enhance their operations. Filipino staff members are also familiar with the BPO services and have a diverse skill set to fulfill various duties. This includes customer service, data entry, back-office duties, and tech support among others.

Outsourcing in the Philippines is an ideal option for companies that are looking to achieve cost savings and access to a global talent pool. Since the majority of professionals in the country are university graduates, you can expect to onboard highly qualified virtual staff members who are proficient in English and are dedicated to accomplishing various tasks before the deadline.

Should I Hire a Virtual Assistant through a Freelance Platform or through a BPO Agency?
While hiring a virtual assistant through a freelance platform is an option, it may not be the best choice for your business. Since the global market has consistently increased over the past few years due to the popularity of remote work, hiring a freelancer is a lot more costly than you may expect.

Aside from this, the rising number of freelancers makes it more difficult for recruitment firms to find top talent. Freelancers are generally known to work on multiple projects and serve various clients at once, which may result in a slower turnaround time affecting overall productivity.

Not to mention that if you hire a freelancer, you will need to review all the applications sent and spend more time on recruitment tasks. This includes pre-screen all the candidates, conducting interviews, onboarding, and staff retainment.

Whereas if you hire through a BPO agency like ShoreAgents, you can guarantee that your virtual staff members are dedicated to your business alone. You can also skip the time-consuming process of hiring as this may not be your expertise – our success team will handle the rest and present the qualified candidates for your business.

At the same time, your virtual staff members are also more likely to stay with a real estate outsourcing company for stability and career growth. In comparison to a freelancer’s global market, hiring through a BPO agency like ShoreAgents ensures that your virtual team members are provided with the necessary work facilities and equipment, fully engaged in the team, and rewarded for their hard work.

How does the outsourcing process begin?
Initially, the process of outsourcing begins once you identify the tasks and functions that need to be delegated.

How to Create a Job Description for Your Virtual Real Estate Assistant?
Writing a job description for a hiring remote real estate associate? It should be well-written and contain specific tasks that need to be done on a daily basis.

Some of the common departments include marketing, finance, and sales. Regardless of the designated department in the industry, it’s best to elaborate on the specifics.

Here are some steps that you can follow to write an effective job description:
Step 1. Define the duties & responsibilities
Indicating the primary tasks of a VA is essential. The responsibilities can always vary depending on your preference. For instance, if you're looking to hire for an entry-level role, then the duties should be aligned.
Step 2. Specify the requirements, expertise, and skills
Include in the job description if you prefer a candidate with or without a degree and experience. Specify the necessary capabilities and skills needed for the assistant job. For example, a degree in business or real estate or administrative work. You can also state skillfulness in computer programs such as Microsoft Office.
Step 3. List all the equipment & software
What equipment and software do you need for your candidate to access? Some of the details can include a high-speed internet connection, a computer, and software for communication. This can include project management tools and bookkeeping software.

What are the Benefits of a Real Estate Virtual Assistant from the Philippines? 
As the director of ShoreAgents, I have explored other locations like South Africa, India, and Vietnam. I’ve outsourced to the Philippines since 2012 and found Filipino remote staff culturally aligned with the West.

The Philippines is an English-speaking country and is generally a Catholic country. This makes it more compatible with businesses in Western countries such as Australia, the USA, and Canada.

English language proficiency in the Philippines is excellent. This makes it easy to communicate with remote staff. The education level is also high, with many people having college and university degrees.

When you hire a real estate virtual staff from the Philippines, you are likely to work with highly educated people. Filipino virtual staff are creative and very proficient in English. They are also happy to do repetitive and back-office tasks with big smiles on their faces.

What Sectors of Real Estate Can a Virtual Assistant Support?
Well, the answer to that is all sectors. Remote VA jobs can be done online or over the phone, regardless if it’s in real estate or other industries.

We have successfully partnered with real estate agencies for sales and property management. This is because these areas entail more back-office work.

We have experience in supporting buyers, agents, mortgage companies, and real estate conveyancing. So, a virtual staff can support any sector of the real estate market. Well-prepared tasks, training, and preparation enable successful outsourcing to remote staff.

Virtual Assistant Services for Real Estate
1. Hire One Agent
Our real estate VA services include an entry-level service that comprises one agent. This service is good for smaller businesses that are looking to get some items off their plate. When it comes to using the one-agent service, we provide a whole bunch of support. Generally, the people taking out this service are new to it.

Due to having only one staff member, they are able to handle a wide range of tasks. Instead of focusing on a bigger business where they may be doing just one task.

The staff member and the client generally need more support to succeed. Our dedicated success team ensures that you’re getting the most out of your outsourcing journey and remote staff.
2. Build a Team
Our secondary service is designed for more support for when your business is expanding. You can hire a completely dedicated team with your agents. We provide scale discounts as you advance to higher service levels and hire more people.

As the business grows, you continue to diversify some of the tasks. You might have started with one agent in the sales admin space and then decided to outsource property management. You might be splitting up your sales admin and your property management to have one person dedicated to each. As the business grows, you can continue to develop your team and, hopefully, a team leader within that new team.
3. Create a Workforce
For bigger businesses, we offer a workforce service. A workforce service is for when you’re almost an expert at outsourcing. You’ve got all your systems in place and division heads to take care of your outsourced team.

So, you can cover many sectors within your business. Instead of being limited to back-office support for property management and minimal sales support.

Since online workers can help you with several tasks, you can now expand your focus on other pillars.

Our workforce model has proven to be very successful. We have teams of more than 25 individuals achieving great results.

What Makes the Best Real Estate Virtual Assistant?
The first step in choosing a virtual staff is recruitment. Finding someone with the right aptitude for the job and who fits within your business is essential.

The best real estate virtual staff should be able to perform simple tasks in your business. It's important to find a committed candidate who can learn and be a valuable long-term team member.
Use cloud-based tools and productivity management software to assign tasks easier. Some of the various tools on the market, such as ClickUp, Monday, Air Table, Asana, and Basecamp.

For instance, you can use forms in ClickUp to drive your remote staff. When a real estate agent lists a property for sale within your business, they fill out the new listing form. This creates a task on ClickUp for your virtual workers to complete.

You can also use education software like Udemy to train on tasks they may not be familiar with. For instance, utilizing it to optimize your real estate website.

When it comes to generating content, tools like Chat GTP can help with writing and proofreading. You can use research to create topics that the tool can easily generate unique content. Recording some audio and transcribing it can also help Chat GTP write like you.

Empower your online workers with the right tools and training to make them your best asset in the real estate business.

Who are the Top Real Estate Virtual Assistant Companies? 
Well, we are going to be biased and say that ShoreAgents is the top real estate virtual assistant company. As an owner of a real estate company, I found different virtual assistant companies lacking. I was hiring offshore staff in the Philippines and discovered factors related to this.
This includes a lack of in-office staff and poor management. When looking for the best real estate virtual assistant company, you need to look for certain things. Here's what you need to consider:
Office Location
First, are they located in an office, and where is their office? Is it situated in a safe part of the Philippines, such as Clark Pampanga, Cebu, or Manila? These things will determine whether they’re the right company for you.
To cite an example, Manila is prone to typhoons, floods, and volcanoes. It is also congested and makes it difficult for workers to get to an office. So this leads to a desire to work remotely with little success in the Philippines. This is also related to living standards, the internet, and the cost of living.
Recruitment
When it comes to recruitment, you need to consider how the company implements its process. This includes testing and filtering candidates, where they advertise, and how they do it. The goal is to have the best remote workers, not just any.
The company should also help you set up your operations in the Philippines and support you. This includes ensuring that your IT and software are both connected. You will also need to be available when the staff member encounters any issues and answer their questions about the process.
Company Engagement & Salary
The most crucial aspect is how the company engages with your staff. Do they have regular staff engagement? What’s the office environment like? Are your employees satisfied with the environment?
It would be disappointing to find the ideal employee, only to have them leave. Ensuring fair treatment and pleasant work environment is crucial.
Ensure that the company pays the right salary and is transparent with what you’re paying your staff member. Pricing varies according to several factors such as track record & education among others.
This depends on the salary level and the type of remote assistant that you are hiring. Outsourcing a remote assistant can save you about a third to a quarter of the cost compared to hiring locally.
If you go to our website under the roles section, we have cost comparison breakdowns. This involves a huge array of different roles throughout the industry. But it is not solely just about cost savings.
The right candidate can not only save you money but also help you generate money. 
For example, hiring remote staff who can boost sales for your real estate company can have a positive impact. Online workers who generate more leads and listings can be a valuable asset to your business.

What is a Property Management Virtual Assistant?
A property management virtual assistant plays a crucial role by providing invaluable support for streamlining operations in the business. Since this role can accomplish the majority of tasks online, they work remotely and utilize various task management tools.

The best property management VA for a property management team should have expertise in organizing workflows and handling multiple tasks. While other firms opt for hiring locally, outsourcing a PMVA offers the most cost-efficient option. Particularly in countries like the Philippines which presents affordable labor expenses due to the low cost of living.

What Can a Property Management Virtual Assistant Do?
The tasks of a PMVA may vary depending on their skillset and experience. It can also depend on the company's assigned tasks in order to support property managers.

The process of property management is basically a flow. A property management virtual assistant handles various stages of the property management process. Starting with onboarding new landlords and advertising properties to attract prospective tenants.

They also manage tenant prospecting, lease agreements, property inspections, and repair coordination. At the same time, PMVAs handle lease renewals, vacates, and relisting tasks, ensuring smooth operations throughout the property management lifecycle.

While the PM's flow is fairly straightforward, it is time-consuming and involves ticking off a lot of boxes. Delegating tasks to a virtual assistant allows property managers to focus on growth and tenant satisfaction.

A property management virtual assistant can help with every step of the flow. Your dedicated team member will dramatically ease the time and administrative burden that is currently slowing down your processes. Let's take a look at some of the primary duties of a PMVA:

Outsourced Your New Property Management
The first step in the property management flow is onboarding new landlords and managing properties.

After securing a new client, your PMVA can handle the meticulous completion of documentation. While it's ideal for landlords to provide all paperwork at once, in reality, you may find yourself chasing details. This includes insurance, smoke alarm information, and bank accounts.

Your offshore staff can efficiently handle these tedious tasks. At the same time, it will free up your time for other important matters. A PMVA will also onboard the client into your systems, including your trust account software.

Outsourced Your Rental Property Advertising
After properly setting up your new client, you can immediately proceed to advertise the property. Of course, your experienced local property management staff will handle photos and property descriptions.

Your VA will handle the task of uploading property information to multiple ad portals such as Zilio, Trademe, Realestate.com.au, Domain, and more. Additionally, they will create and distribute social media posts across platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Whatsapp.

Outsource Your Rental Enquiries
Once you’ve got your successful advertising campaign in place, there will naturally be a surge in inquiries. Most of these are fairly basic and don’t require the time of your local staff. Leave it to your property management virtual assistant to handle emails, answer questions about the property, and advise about viewings.

Your PMVA can schedule inspection appointments using the online calendar and notify prospective tenants of their viewing time. They will also gather feedback from tenants, helping to distinguish interested and uninterested individuals. All your property manager needs to do then is follow up with the warmest leads and not deal with time wasters.

Outsourced Your Rental Application
By now, you’ll have a few good prospects who will have submitted applications. Your PMVA will process the app and make sure all the information is complete. If it’s not, they can immediately contact the applicants via SMS or email and fill in any missing details.

After that, it’s a simple process of checking rental, professional, and employment references. It is simple in theory but time-consuming in practice.

All of these tasks are vital but require a significant time investment. A PMVA can handle these details while property managers focus on prospecting for new landlords and properties. Once all the info and references are 100% completed, your PM passes the applications on to the landlord for approval.

Outsourced Your Rental Lease
At this point, it’s time to create a lease and start collecting money. Your PMVA will carefully follow all appropriate standards to create the lease and send it over to the tenant via email. They can then sign it via DocuSign or whatever system your office uses. Simultaneously, they'll inform the tenant about the deposit transfer process and ensure accurate setup in your accounting software.

They will provide the tenant with the necessary information for proper bond lodging, which is crucial for your property management business. Each step is vital but time-consuming. Once you know the requirements, your PMVA takes responsibility for completing the entire checklist.

Outsource Your Rental Initial Condition Report
Property inspections require the presence of your onsite team as offshore staff have limitations in performing this task. The property manager conducts the initial inspection report and takes photos using an app like PropertyMe. Subsequently, the PMVA completes the report, sends it to the tenant, and obtains their signature.

Outsource Your Rental Receipt
When we say that a PMVA is part of every step of the property management process, we mean it. This includes rent receipting where your property management VA can process your accounts and reconcile rent payments.

They’ll immediately flag which tenants are in arrears so that your local PM can follow up. Or they can even send the initial SMS or email themselves, giving the tenant a quick nudge. Your PMVA will follow your arrears process and bring in the big guns, i.e. your property manager, only when necessary.

Outsource Your Rental Maintenance
By setting up an online process, tenants can conveniently submit maintenance requests via Facebook or SMS. Once your PMVA receives the request, they can get in touch with your approved tradespeople and organize the repairs. 

Of course, as part of your maintenance process, you’ll include an approval step from the property manager. The PMVA then coordinates between the tradesperson and tenant, finds a suitable time, or arranges access.

This eliminates the time-consuming task of engaging in three-way conversations, increasing property managers' efficiency. With a dedicated virtual assistant, a property manager can potentially double the number of properties managed, as observed in our experience. A property manager can double their portfolio from 150 to 300 properties within weeks.

Outsource Your Rental Routine Inspections
As part of the initial leasing process, your PMVA will set up calendar alerts to set up routine inspections. Your property management team maintains online calendars with defined availability for inspections.

Using that information, your PMVA will coordinate with tenants to arrange the perfect time to carry out a routine inspection. They efficiently process the property manager's notes and photos into comprehensive reports, directly sending them to the landlord.

Outsource Your Rental Lease Renewals
When it’s nearing the end of a lease period, your PMVA will get an alert to start following up. Generally, you want to avoid empty properties, but this will depend on what the property manager, landlord, and tenant decide. Your PMVA will contact their property manager between 60 to 90 days before the lease is due to expire.

This allows the PM to understand the landlord's preferences. If the landlord approves the renewal, the PMVA informs the tenant and initiates the process. End-of-lease management is vital for maintaining landlord and tenant satisfaction. The PMVA ensures a seamless transition during this crucial period.
In the event of a tenant vacating, the PMVA makes sure that both parties have the necessary information for a smooth transition. At the same time, promptly resumes preparing advertising materials to find a new tenant.

Virtual Assistant Tools List: Which Tools are PMVAs familiar with?
Using tools empowers PMVAs to enhance efficiency, productivity, and effectiveness in property management tasks. These tools automate tasks, organize information, track progress, and facilitate seamless collaboration with property managers and tenants.

The following tools provide PMVAs with streamlined workflows, improved communication channels, and access to valuable data and resources:

Process and Procedure for Property Management Outsourcing
While you were reading this, hopefully, you noticed that the success of hiring a PMVA depends on procedures and processes. If your business lacks integration and communication among its various departments, managing offshore staff may present challenges.

It's important to note that hiring an offshore team is not a silver bullet. It requires time and effort to effectively manage your business. However, it can significantly reduce administrative tasks for your local staff, allowing them to focus on the work they enjoy.

What are the Advantages of Hiring a Property Management Virtual Assistant from the Philippines?
Several businesses prefer the Philippines as a source for outsourcing staff for a number of good reasons. The country’s established BPO industry provides a range of agencies to help businesses find their ideal offshore solution.

The Philippines excels in English proficiency and boasts a highly skilled workforce. With a mature offshoring model, it is the top choice for outsourcing needs. Here are some of the perks of offshoring a PMVA based in the Philippines:

Achieve Ultimate Cost-Savings 
In comparison to hiring a local PMVA, outsourcing in the Philippines is less costly. This is because of the country's low cost of living which reflects the labor costs as well.
A real estate agency in the USA will pay approximately one-third of the local rate for a Philippine-based assistant. In fact, employers can hire three virtual assistants for the price of one. Not to mention that there are other oncost fees and taxes to consider in other countries.
For instance, the average salary of a real estate virtual assistant in Australia costs $60,091 AUD. This excludes recruitment costs, payroll taxes, and other mandatory costs. Whereas in the Philippines, you can expect to pay $21,385 AUD inclusive of benefits, government charges, and ShoreAgents' fees.
This cost advantage makes outsourcing to the Philippines an attractive option for real estate agencies. Particularly those looking to maximize their workflow efficiency and save on staffing expenses.

Excellent Language Proficiency
The Philippines boasts high English proficiency rates comparable to those in Europe and English-speaking countries. Despite its Asian-Pacific location, the country demonstrates remarkable English proficiency.
All government communication, notices, and documentation are in English so expect to onboard staff members who are language proficient. At ShoreAgents, we filter the best candidates for your team. Our recruitment team ensures that your additional staff members are university graduates and can communicate effectively.

Onboard Highly Skilled Workforce
Not only can you achieve cost-savings and communicate well with your staff, but their skillset is also extensive. With a workforce of over 45 million people, the Philippines possesses many highly skilled individuals. Many young Filipinos utilize tuition-free technical schools and state colleges to enhance their education.
The government acknowledges the importance of a skilled workforce and has implemented policies and incentives to promote prolonged education. This has enabled Filipinos to acquire both general and specialized expertise.

Technological Competence
The majority of Filipino virtual assistants utilize various property management software and tools to accomplish tasks. The best part is that upon training, most of them are already familiar with using various tech applications.
By hiring through a BPO agency like ShoreAgents, we ensure the use of software productivity tools for efficient operations. We take care of preparing all the necessary tools required for workers to carry out their tasks effectively.

Cultural Fit
The Philippines has a strong cultural affinity with Western countries. Because of this, it has ensured smooth collaboration and understanding of business practices and customer service expectations. Working with Filipinos will not give as much culture shock compared to other countries.

How to Manage Your Outsourced Property Management Virtual Assistant?
Outsourcing in your property management department presents challenges, especially when it comes to day-to-day team management. Property management software often lacks the necessary detail for optimal business operations despite having basic task allocation and workflows. Here are five expert insights on how you can manage your outsourced PMVA:

Define Clear Expectations & Goals 
By providing detailed instructions to complete tasks and meet quality standards, you can expect your VA to excel. Effective communication of goals and setting deadlines will help your VA understand expectations. It is still necessary to train and provide guidance since no one else knows your business better than you.

Establish Effective Communication Channels
Set up regular communication channels with your virtual assistant to stay connected and provide guidance. Utilize tools like email, instant messaging, or project management platforms to facilitate clear and efficient communication. For instance, Slack is one of the recommended platforms for team communication. Particularly in the real estate business where professionals can organize their collaboration.

Provide Continuing Training & Resources
Invest time in training your virtual assistant on your property management processes, tools, and systems. Provide them with access to necessary resources, documents, and guidelines. This will enable them to perform their tasks effectively.
Fortunately, technology has advanced significantly in the past decade, offering impressive software solutions. We suggest exploring various tools to find the best fit for your needs. However, we highly recommend a project management tool such as Clickup.

Monitor and Provide Feedback for Improvement
Provide constructive feedback and guidance to help your virtual assistant improve their performance. Acknowledge their strengths and offer suggestions for areas where they can enhance their skills or efficiency. Regularly reviewing the progress of your virtual assistant's work to ensure they are on track. 

Staff Engagement
Build a positive working relationship with your virtual assistant by fostering open communication, trust, and mutual respect. Encourage collaboration and create a supportive environment that promotes their professional growth and satisfaction.
Conduct periodic performance evaluations to assess your virtual assistant's performance against set goals and expectations. Recognize their achievements and address any areas that may require improvement.

Evidently, the cost difference between hiring locally vs virtually in the Philippines is enormous. Not only can you save money, but you also get to access a talent pool for your real estate business.

With the price of one local staff member, you can recruit two or more in the Philippines. Aside from cost-efficiency, you can expect your staff to be efficient in English and handle various tasks.

A Day in the Life of a Virtual Bookkeeper from the Philippines 
What is the daily routine of a virtual bookkeeper, for instance, in a residential real estate business? You will have expenses and generate revenue on a daily basis. All of these things need to be accurate and reconciled daily. So that you, as the business owner, can have a clear report on profits and losses and make informed decisions.

Imagine that you have a bookkeeper located in the Philippines with their daily tasks. This will free you from engaging in unproductive functions that are not within your scope of responsibilities.
For example, with three property settlements sold, commissions need to be allocated accurately for distribution among agents.

The bookkeeper needs to report the income generated from the sale. At the same time, you also need to pay the expenses incurred during the sale. This includes marketing the property and other related costs.

Additionally, you will have expenses related to generating more listings on a daily basis. Expenses must be accurately categorized in the chart of accounts to determine the true profit per sale.

Your virtual bookkeeper in the Philippines, located here at ShoreAgents, will take care of all these repetitive tasks.

Suppose it is mid-month, and on the same day, you are managing a rental roll consisting of approximately 1,000 properties. Rent must be received and accounts reconciled on that day to distribute funds to landlords and collect management fees. The same process applies to expenses, and you will also have salaries to be paid out through payroll. Again, your virtual bookkeeper can handle all of this.

So, on a daily basis, your bookkeeper will be a low-cost but highly valuable resource. And now that you know you can hire in the Philippines, it will not break the bank either.

Advantages of Accountants in the Real Estate Business
The expertise of accountants in the real estate business can bring several advantages. Their contributions offer growth and success to real estate ventures. Here are some of the perks of having a good accountant for your real estate business:

Make informed decisions
Typically, real estate business owners are more focused on sales. This can result in a lack of attention to detail when it comes to accounting. Accountants help you make well-informed decisions with their expertise, analysis, and insights. They contribute strategic ideas to extract the most profit and minimize risks in the real estate industry.

 Risk management 
It's risky to overlook the return on investment (ROI) in your property management business. Knowing your revenue and income numbers by heart is crucial for running a successful business, despite the excitement they bring.
There are many pressures on real estate businesses. For instance, increased operating costs such as subscription fees, software expenses, and wages.
However, the commissions you charge are decreasing. And in some markets, property prices are declining. This can lead to lower transaction percentages.
Accountants assess risks' potential impact. This helps businesses make informed choices that minimize drawbacks and maximize returns.

 Financial Analysis
While you may be excited about the returns, you could be operating on a slim margin of 10% or even lower. For a profitable and robust business, you need a reliable accountant to devise strategies for a desired ROI range of 20-33%.
Accountants analyze financial data related to real estate investments, projects, and properties. They assess the financial capability of potential ventures and evaluate costs and benefits. Most importantly, they determine the ROI.

 Budgeting and Forecasting
Accountants assist in creating and maintaining budgets for real estate projects or ventures. They forecast income and expenses, taking into account various factors. This includes market conditions, financing costs, and operating expenses.

 Tax Planning
Real estate transactions have complex tax implications. Accountants with real estate tax expertise offer guidance on tax planning and maximizing benefits. They assist businesses in comprehending tax implications for decisions. This involves property acquisitions, sales, or rental income.

How will your Real Estate Accountant Work in Partnership with your Bookkeeper?
An accountant can work with your bookkeeper, ensuring that everything is entered correctly based on their advice. They create a chart of accounts to make sense for the accountant. But most importantly, it will be beneficial for you as the owner.

Real estate has specific areas where an ordinary accountant may lack understanding. For example, trust accounts, commission splits, and property advertising.

We have seen instances where property advertising gets mixed up with business advertising. These aspects should be treated separately. Property marketing expenses are typically billed to the seller and can be recovered. While business advertising costs should be categorized individually.

These are important to make sure you can have clear reporting and make good decisions. To ensure effective financial management, they can collaborate by:

Data Entry and Bookkeeping - The bookkeeper can enter data into the accounting software to keep track of daily financial transactions. This can help maintain accurate financial records and reconcile bank statements.
Financial Reporting -The real estate accountant can utilize the data maintained by the bookkeeper. This is so that they can generate comprehensive financial reports. They analyze financial information and prepare balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.
Exchange financial information - The real estate accountant and bookkeeper exchange financial information and maintain accurate records. They collaborate to resolve any discrepancies and address financial concerns. As a result, they can provide a clear picture of the business's financial position.

Can Real Estate Accountants Work Virtually?
Yes, a property accountant can certainly work virtually. This is particularly because most of the duties can be accomplished online. However, it's important to ensure that you have suitable systems in place.

A good example is providing software tools for effective financial reporting. At ShoreAgents, we take care of the following:

A well-defined job description to find suitable accountants for your real estate business. Afterward, we will present a shortlist of candidates for you to choose from.
A cloud-based accounting software for accountants to properly perform their tasks. This ensures that they are functional during work hours.
Human resources support and legal aspects of worker employment will be handled efficiently. Through a web-accessible HR hub, ShoreAgents manage panels for logged hours, employment contracts, leave requests, & worker tardiness among others. 
Gaining team buy-in and helping remote team members to feel engaged at work. ShoreAgents celebrates work anniversaries, and birthdays, and encourages activity clubs & monthly games. 

Cost Comparison of Real Estate Accountants Globally
The primary factor affecting a real estate accountant's salary is their location. Although there are other considerations such as skillsets, experience, and specific duties. This means that if they live in high-cost-of-living areas, their wages are likely to be high as well.

As a result, several companies globally look for offshoring options. Let's take a look at the salary comparison of an accountant.

Note that the salary amounts displayed for other countries below exclude additional costs. In comparison to the wages in the Philippines, it includes government charges, benefits, and ShoreAgents' fees.

What does a Mortgage Virtual Assistant do?
Mortgage virtual assistants are essential for supporting the mortgage process, allowing professionals to concentrate on core business tasks. By handling administrative responsibilities and providing exceptional customer service, they contribute to increased efficiency and client satisfaction.

Mortgage VAs commonly perform repetitive tasks such as data entry and appointment scheduling among other tasks. However, this depends on the mortgage firm's requirements and business goals. The majority of mortgage firms create a list of tasks for their virtual staff overseas and set deadlines.

Duties and Responsibilities of a Mortgage VA
The mortgage process involves time-consuming tasks that can prolong the overall timeline. For instance, assessing a borrower's loan application documents to closing can generally be complex.

Each phase requires a keen eye for details and double-checking information on all submitted requirements. Not to mention other external factors involving interest rates or housing market trends, which may prolong the entire mortgage process further.

Therefore, to expedite the process and avoid further delays, this is where a virtual assistant walks into the picture. Check out the typical tasks of a mortgage virtual assistant:

Collection of Required Documents
Each borrower needs to submit the necessary documentation when applying for a loan. The mortgage VA will help verify the borrower's financial history. This includes the borrower's monthly income, employment history, and credit history among others.
Credit Evaluation
A mortgage VA collaborates with a mortgage underwriter to carefully assess borrowers' credit standing. The underwriting process thoroughly evaluates the borrower's financial profile and the property's value.
Property Assessment
An appraisal is important to evaluate the property's worth and ensure it meets the LTV requirements. A digital assistant helps in scheduling appraisals and waiting for the appraiser's report.
Loan Application Processing
In this process, the mortgage processor guarantees that all required information is complete. Depending on the complexity of the loan, this can take a longer time without a VA's help.
Loan Approval and Closing
The virtual mortgage assistant's primary goal is to ensure smooth underwriting and processing. Upon the loan's approval, they will also assist in the closing process.

Where to Outsource a Mortgage VA?

Both choices offer distinct advantages, catering to your specific needs and preferences. Discover the following pros and cons to help you make an informed decision:

1. Freelance Platforms
Upwork, Freelancer, Fiverr, and other online freelance platforms offer an extensive talent pool, including Mortgage VAs. You can post your job requirements and gain access to various candidates. 

However, due to the global market, the expenses of hiring a freelancer have significantly increased. With the surge in remote work and online platforms, freelancers now have access to a broader market. 

This allows them to offer their services to clients worldwide and has resulted in a larger pool of freelancers. Therefore, this intensifies the competition for top talent. Consequently, highly skilled and sought-after freelancers may demand higher rates for their services.

Employees tend to stay longer with real estate outsourcing companies because of the stability and potential for career growth. This may not be as strong in the global market for freelancers. Beyond reliable income, employees can participate in engagement programs and feel a sense of belonging within the team.

In contrast, short-term freelancers can cost more for your business, as they often take on multiple projects and clients. This can lead to higher turnover rates, necessitating additional time and resources to find and onboard new employees.

2. Offshore BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) Company
Partnering with a real estate BPO agency like ShoreAgents can boost time and improve productivity. Our intensive recruitment process guarantees that we provide the best offshore staff for your business.

Your virtual assistants at ShoreAgents will have access to quality facilities. We provide a complete computer with dual screens, a webcam, and a headset. Most importantly, our modern office is equipped with a backup power generator.

What does a Virtual Assistant in Construction do?
Construction virtual assistants are highly skilled professionals who provide remote support to construction firms. Their immense project management skills and support capabilities contribute to the overall success of each construction project.

While their duties vary accordingly, this function plays an essential role to fulfill construction-related tasks. For instance, some of the most time-consuming tasks that hold back construction firms are data entry and research. Instead of concentrating on various phases of construction, they may spend more time on these less important duties.

This is where virtual assistants enter the scene to lend a hand. They can manage schedules, track the progress of projects, and respond to client inquiries. Oftentimes, they also collaborate with other roles in the firm when necessary.

A construction VA can coordinate tasks with an engineer to ensure the fulfillment of engineering specifications. Similarly, working alongside an architect to communicate design-related tasks.

Tasks and Obligations of a Construction VA
Taking on most of the back-office work, the duties of a virtual construction aide depend on the firm's needs. This dynamic role may handle various pivotal tasks to help streamline the operations of construction projects.

Here are some of the duties that a construction virtual support can fulfill:
Coordination of Construction Projects - A virtual assistant takes care of schedules, resources, and tasks. This involves coordinating duties among team members and subcontractors for the smooth progress of each project.
Management of Construction Documents - Organizing construction-related documents such as blueprints and contracts is important. With the help of a VA, construction professionals can easily access and retrieve important data.
Offer Excellent Customer Service - Construction firms should maintain consistent communication with existing clientele. Each satisfied customer provides positive feedback to your firm, which a virtual assistant can significantly enhance.

Supplier Coordination - For seamless and efficient project integration, a VA communicates with both vendors and suppliers. This duty ensures the timely procurement of materials and properly tracking deliveries.
Data Entry & Handling -  This involves managing project-related data and creating progress reports. Typically, this repetitive task is quite time-consuming. Having an assistant who can double-check the information is important as you can often overlook the details.

Aside from the duties mentioned above, a virtual assistant can also support tracking project expenses. With the help of a real estate accountant, they can organize financial documents for better cost control. At the same time, work on social media or marketing-related tasks to establish the firm's expertise. Therefore, the tasks that a virtual assistant can be flexible based on your firm's demands.

Where to Outsource a Construction VA?
When outsourcing a construction VA for your real estate business, you have two main choices. Hiring through freelance platforms or a reliable real estate BPO agency like ShoreAgents.

Both options have unique benefits, tailored to your needs. Explore the pros and cons below to make an informed choice:

1. Freelance Platforms
Online freelance platforms like Upwork and Freelancer provide a wide range of talent. If you decide to hire on freelance platforms, you need to list your job requirements and connect with various candidates.

However, the global market has led to increased expenses for hiring freelancers. The rise in remote work and online platforms has expanded the freelancer market, allowing them to offer services globally. This has resulted in more freelancers, increasing competition for top talent, and potentially higher rates.

Do note that short-term freelancers might cost more for your business, as they handle multiple projects and clients. This can lead to higher turnover rates, requiring more time and resources to find and onboard replacements.

Outsourced employees at real estate outsourcing companies often stay longer due to stability and career growth opportunities. This isn't as prevalent in the global freelancer market. Aside from a consistent income, employees can engage in programs and feel a sense of belonging.

2. Offshore BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) Company
Outsourcing a virtual assistant through a real estate BPO agency like ShoreAgents offers the advantage of streamlined recruitment. This ensures access to skilled professionals who are pre-screened for industry expertise. This approach provides businesses with a reliable source of talent while allowing them to focus on core operations and strategic growth.

Your virtual assistants at ShoreAgents will also enjoy working as they have access to enjoy quality facilities. Our modern office is further equipped with a backup power generator. We provide complete computers with dual screens, webcams, and headsets.

SECTORS
Real Estate Outsourcing: Definition and Tasks
Real Estate Outsourcing involves assigning real estate tasks to an external company or individual. This can include tasks such as property management, marketing, research, and administrative functions, among others. 

In essence, real estate outsourcing involves partnering with a third-party provider to handle specific aspects of the real estate business. This frees up valuable time and resources in order for companies to focus on their core competencies.

Outsourcing offers access to external expertise and resources to achieve business goals. It enhances efficiency, saves costs, and boosts productivity in real estate companies.

In short, real estate outsourcing is a smart way for real estate companies to leverage the knowledge and expertise of others. Through this, they improve their operations and stay ahead of the competition.

Commercial Real Estate Outsourcing
Typically, the trend in real estate outsourcing is focused on the residential sector and is more common in this area. However, that does not mean that outsourcing is not a viable option for commercial real estate companies. The benefits are the same, though the tasks may differ slightly. Virtual staff manages lease renewals for commercial offices and shops, while outsourcing is used for homes and apartments.

For a commercial real estate company looking to outsource, the process is the same. The first step is to identify tasks that are slowing down the company and are of low value. Then, determine how the commercial real estate virtual assistant can complete these tasks through proper processes and training.

Corporate Real Estate Outsourcing
Outsourcing in real estate isn’t just for small one-agent or team operations. Large corporate businesses can also reap the benefits of outsourcing and build an entire virtual workforce. For this reason, they can support their brand, franchises, agents, property managers, and more.

Large corporations often have hidden virtual teams handling tasks at a corporate level, without internal teams being aware. This efficient arrangement allows the corporate business to allocate time and resources to other crucial tasks.

For big brands or franchises, outsourcing real estate services and providing them under your brand is a smart move. It can reduce overhead costs across the entire corporation. At the same time, it provides more value to your team and helps them keep their enthusiasm and productivity.

So, if you’re a corporate real estate business looking to streamline your operations, outsourcing is definitely worth considering. With the right provider and processes, you can unlock the benefits of outsourcing and take your business to the next level.

How to Start Outsourcing in Real Estate?
Getting started with outsourcing in real estate can be easier than you think. A lack of knowledge can hinder progress, but it doesn't imply a lack of creativity. Hiring a Filipino virtual assistant can be scary if you’ve never done it before. However, keep in mind that they possess the capabilities to accomplish tasks like any other human.

Even without being physically present for inspections, tasks that can be done online or over the phone can still be managed. This can be made possible through proper training and processes. Here are some simple steps to get started:

Identify tasks that are slowing you down, repetitive, or of low value.
Categorize these tasks based on difficulty.
Look at all the tasks that you currently have a process for and select those that are easy to train. It's essential to create a work process if you don’t have one in place.
Draft a basic job role outline for the tasks you want to delegate.
Develop a training plan for when your worker begins.
Invest in productivity software, such as ClickUp or Monday, to manage your team from a distance.
Appoint someone to be responsible for leading your virtual team member, as they need direction just like your in-house employees.

If you require assistance to begin, feel free to contact us, and we'll gladly provide guidance throughout the process.

Understanding Real Estate Outsourcing Tasks and Responsibilities: A Social Media Example
When outsourcing, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the tasks you want to delegate. To ensure success, your tasks should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. Unfortunately, many people start outsourcing with unclear goals, leading to unmet expectations.

For example, simply stating “I need someone to handle my social media” is not enough. To effectively outsource your social media management, you need to be specific about the tasks you want to be done. This includes answering questions such as what photos to use, what quotes to include, and which hashtags to add.

Instead of utilizing vague information, it is imperative to provide specific and detailed instructions. For instance, “Create 25 Instagram posts using photos from this folder and quotes from the provided testimonials. Research appropriate hashtags and add 3-7 hashtags per post. After approval, schedule 5 posts per day using this Hootsuite account.”

By setting clear and defined goals, you’ll be able to measure your virtual assistant’s performance. Through this, you will be able to determine if they’re doing a good job. But keep in mind that outsourcing does require some investment in education and training to ensure success. This aids in identifying outsourced areas of your business and tasks suitable for delegation within the outsourcing framework.

The Importance of Approval Processes in Real Estate Outsourcing
When outsourcing tasks in real estate, one critical aspect that’s often overlooked is the approval process. Who in your organization will be responsible for reviewing and approving the work completed by your virtual assistant?

Your outsourced assistant operates without a conventional supervisor and may receive tasks from various staff members without direct oversight. Hence, implementing an approval process is essential to review each task before its release under your business's name.

There are various tools you can use to track task progress and ensure that an approval process is in place. Project management apps like Trello or Asana can help, or you can use a simple Excel spreadsheet. The key is to establish an accountability barrier between your virtual assistant and the public representation of your business.

Don’t neglect the importance of an approval process in real estate outsourcing. Implementing this ensures that your virtual assistant's work aligns with your standards and presents your business in the best possible light.

Are There Any Downsides to Outsourcing for Real Estate?
Outsourcing is a brilliant way to start trimming the fat from your business and make easy increases to your profit margin. As outlined already, though, there is still a bit of work involved for you. But if you understand your business, you can easily find the low-hanging fruit and start making cost savings immediately.

The best way to start outsourcing is slowly by starting with one or two simple tasks. It's advisable to hone your process and learn to better understand the system. You may prefer to work with people from one country over another. 

It is possible that you lack knowledge regarding the appropriate payment amount. You may not realize how difficult a particular task is. Starting out outsourcing can be a relatively low-cost investment, but don’t throw yourself into it all at once. Besides the research involved, there are other downsides that you need to be aware of.

Lack of Loyalty
Whether you hire someone directly through Upwork or via an agency, that person is not necessarily loyal to you. Even the most perfect person on Upwork can suddenly drop you as a client if they get a better offer. No contract between you forces them to give a certain period of notice. Regardless of their affinity for your brand, you are simply one of many clients they serve.

Inconstancy
When working with an agency, you’ll be drawing on a pool of specialists. This is great because it means the job will always get done, but you do also lose an element of control. Can we expect the current individual to perform as effectively as the previous individual did last month?

Will you have to remind them again that certain expenses need to be reconciled to a specific account? Yes, the agency should take care of that side. However, if you’re being assigned a different person each month, then you can’t be guaranteed consistency.

Loss of Privacy
Often you’ll need to share sensitive documents and data to get your tasks done by an outsourced person. Think of what they’ll need access to social media accounts, website passwords, back-end processes, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Docs, etc.

Certain programs enable you to restrict user access, preventing them from causing significant harm or carrying out unwanted actions. But as already mentioned, your outsourced worker doesn’t necessarily owe you any loyalty. Even if they sign an NDA if they release sensitive information about your business, can you pursue them legally?

Real Estate Outsourcing versus Offshoring Explained
Outsourcing entails delegating specific parts of your back office to an individual or group for completion. It is task-specific and there is a different type of outsourcing called offshoring. 
This is where you hire an offshore employee to join your team. If they are supporting one member of your domestic team, they are usually referred to as a real estate virtual assistant. 

Although an offshore employee will be responsible for a number of different tasks, their role is usually not task-specific. Just like any of your other staff, they fulfill a role, not just a task. So whereas outsourcing is task-specific, an offshore employee is role-specific.

Moving from Outsourcing to Offshoring
In our experience, a real estate business will typically outsource a specific task for a defined period of time. A good example is lease renewals. A real estate agency finds that it has fallen behind in this area. 

They hire an offshore team member through an outsourcing company to handle lease renewals for 3 to 6 months. The contracting company is accountable for training, supervising, and overseeing the progress of this task on a daily basis.

Keep in mind that in this example, the person assigned to your business is not your employee. However, they will be working only on your business so there are fewer problems associated with loyalty. 

Real estate companies often explore outsourcing as they contemplate their offshore requirements. However, the complexity of their needs may surpass their suitability. While outsourcing works well for the aforementioned tasks, there may come a point where a full-time staff member becomes necessary.

If you’re looking for a full-time offshore staff member to join your team, you should be searching for offshoring. For a lot of businesses, this is the next step after outsourcing. As mentioned, this is when you hire an offshore employee to join your team.

Real Estate Outsourcing & Offshoring Trends for 2023
The year has started off strong, witnessing a significant surge in remote staffing compared to the previous year. Now that the pandemic seems to finally be under control, businesses are returning to normal operations. 

However, there are still some pressures on the global real estate industry. This includes declining volumes, rising interest rates, and other factors, which are putting pressure on businesses. This is why companies are now turning to outsourcing in the Philippines, even those who have never considered it before. We expect this trend to continue and hope to see you join us on this journey.

Mortgage Process Outsourcing Services & Solutions

The mortgage industry's constant evolution is driving lenders and financial institutions to seek sustainable growth by analyzing market trends. Mortgage companies experience fluctuations in the housing market and are looking for ways to overcome certain challenges.

For instance, changes in regulatory requirements demand them to closely monitor compliance to prevent costly violations. Allocating budget is important for mortgage companies to ensure their adherence to laws and reporting requirements. There are also operational and staffing costs, along with technology platforms and software expenses to consider.

Budget constraints due to economic factors also highly impact the profitability of mortgage companies. And for this reason, they look for strategic financial planning to guarantee long-term success in the mortgage industry.

This is where real estate outsourcing steps in to enhance the effectiveness of the mortgage process. As a business owner, it's difficult to carry all the weight on your shoulders. You may find yourself focusing on time-consuming & non-core activities instead of looking at revenue projections and developing business plans.

The digital era has now allowed mortgage firms to delegate laborious tasks to enhance the efficiency of their operations. Building a team to do mortgage underwriting, loan processing, accounting, and other roles has never been this easier.

Without a doubt, outsourcing has helped several mortgage firms to reduce high-volume duties and improve overall productivity. If you are interested to learn more about leading a successful mortgage outsourcing service, then this article is for you.

What is Mortgage Process Outsourcing?
Mortgage process outsourcing involves assigning tasks to a specialized team of experts to handle the mortgage process. Due to the increased demands of borrowers and other factors, mortgage lenders may experience poor turnaround time and mismanaged document systems.

As the borrower's demand grows and industry policies change, mortgage lenders turn to mortgage process outsourcing services to manage scale. In simpler terms, when a borrower applies for a mortgage, an external team handles the tedious tasks on their behalf. This includes preparing all the necessary paperwork, communicating with the borrower, reviewing their financial information, and the list goes on.

Instead of the mortgage lender working on these tasks, a reliable external company will accomplish them on their behalf. ShoreAgents is a leading real estate staffing & Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) company that specializes in mortgage services.

Whether you need to hire one agent or create a workforce to accomplish mortgage-related tasks, we have your back. Our success team at ShoreAgents ensures that you onboard the most qualified staff to streamline your operations.



Benefits of Mortgage Process Outsourcing Services
In general, outsourcing offers several benefits that mortgage companies can take advantage of. Learning about the advantages of outsourcing can help you make informed business decisions. Here are some of the benefits of mortgage process outsourcing:

Minimized Lead Time
Depending on the complexity of mortgage transactions, the process usually involves time-consuming tasks. From document verification to post-closing activities, an outsourced real estate virtual assistant can help complete these faster and more accurately.
Through this, you can keep up with the increasing demand and gain the flexibility to meet deadlines. Having a swift and reliable process can also attract more borrowers, which contributes to your business's profitability.

High-Quality Results 
Delegating the heavy lifting of mortgage work to experts guarantees high-quality and accurate results. Particularly when you partner with an outsourcing company with experience in mortgage-related tasks and expertise in compliance.
You can guarantee that your business stays updated with changing mortgage regulations. This also boomerangs to minimizing expenses, reducing the risk of errors, and avoiding penalties.

Achieve Cost Savings
Reducing operational costs without sacrificing the quality of work is possible through outsourcing. In comparison to hiring in-person staff, you get access to a global talent pool at a lower cost. You may also need to put up an office for in-person staff, which outsourcing companies like ShoreAgents already provide.
This is why outsourcing in the Philippines is getting more popular. Aside from the fact that it offers cost-efficient solutions, the country is also proud of its highly-skilled workforce. At ShoreAgents, all you have to worry about is identifying the tasks and training, while we take care of the rest.

Concentrate on Core Strengths 
Mortgage services demand niche skills that require specialized knowledge and comprehension. For instance, an escrow officer facilitates a smooth and efficient closing process throughout a mortgage transaction. Having a keen eye for details is essential for reviewing documents which can take up most of your time.
Outsourcing non-core duties will allow you to focus on your main responsibilities. For instance, managing compliance risks and expanding your customer base. This enables mortgage companies to maximize returns and progress without further distractions on tasks that matter less.

Access to Advanced Technology
Outsourcing companies often invest in mortgage automation and other real estate software productivity tools. Part of their services gives you access to the latest innovations without paying for membership or upgrading costs.

Outsourcing certain tasks such as maintenance coordination and tenant inquiries can help property managers focus on income-generating tasks. They can prioritize sales, client relationships, and business expansion.

It is a known fact that property managers can generate more income by handling hundreds or even thousands of properties. And while that sounds rewarding, time-consuming tasks are expected to pile up as the business grows. This explains why property managers and property management companies are seeking to outsource various aspects of their operations.

By having a dedicated team of professionals, they can significantly improve the operations' efficiency by reducing time and paperwork. These team members, serving as virtual property management assistants, are skilled in handling the complexities of property management. Their support will result in increased proficiency as they take care of non-core tasks. 

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Property managers and property management companies outsource diverse functions in their operations to increase efficiency and productivity. 
There are several back-office tasks that can be outsourced to optimize the property management processes. This includes but is not limited to, property bookkeeping, marketing campaigns, and administrative support.
Outsourcing back-office operations can help business owners to save approximately 70% cost savings. In comparison to hiring locally, you will need to consider increased labor expenses and other overhead costs.

What Back-office Tasks Can Property Managers Outsource?
In general, property management companies outsource various repetitive administrative tasks to streamline their operations. Depending on the company's specific needs and goals, they can outsource several functions. 

For instance, they may hire a customer service representative for tenant/landlord support or a property management accountant to collect rent.

Your outsourced staff with ShoreAgents can help with the following back-end administration part of this process:

Pre-Listing
The pre-listing phase plays a crucial role in setting the stage for a successful property management business. This phase encompasses various essential tasks that property managers undertake to secure new properties under their management. Some of the pre-listing tasks involve the following:

Lead Generation - this is vital as property managers actively seek potential rental properties for management. 
Market Research - property managers analyze the local real estate market and gather insights through market research. This helps them determine the competitive landscape. At the same time, rental rates and potential demand for specific property types. 
Approaching Landlords - property managers proactively communicate and build relationships with landlords. They will reach out to landlords who may have properties that could benefit from property management services.
Property Assessments - this process is important for property managers to provide accurate information to landlords and set realistic expectations. It also involves evaluating the property's condition and identifying potential property maintenance.
Presenting Management Proposals - this task involves outlining comprehensive management plans and services tailored to the specific property. It includes marketing plans, tenant screening processes, and financial reporting among others. 

The pre-listing phase also involves tasks such as going through terms and conditions and signing the management agreement document. Afterward, the property management phase begins. This is where property managers take over the day-to-day management tasks to ensure overall property performance and success. 

Listing
The listing phase is where property managers prepare and showcase a property for rent. During this phase, a series of tasks are undertaken to ensure a smooth and successful rental process. Here are the tasks that you can outsource in the listing process:

Determine Property Rent - setting an appropriate rental price varies according to the location, property size, and current market conditions. Property managers will have to conduct market research in order to maximize the return on investment.

Advertise the Property -  Advertising is important in order to reach a wide audience of prospective tenants. This is where property managers use social media and other platforms to promote the property. They will post the listings on the agency's website, real estate websites, and various social media channels. The advertisement includes the schedule of the open house, the soonest availability for the property, and the rent required. In addition to this, photos and a description of the properties are also included.
Respond to Inquiries - once the property is listed everywhere, there will be several inquiries from interested tenants. Addressing their questions and scheduling property inspections or open houses will allow them to view the property.
Receiving tenancy applications from prospective tenants - This process involves reviewing the applications & conducting background checks to assess the applicant's profile. Your offshore team member can review the applicants' cost-effectiveness ratio and contact their previous tenancies. This way, they can check if they have maintained their previous rental in exemplary condition. At the same time, identify if they have been diligent in paying their rent on time.
Approving a tenant for the property - the property manager will approve tenants on behalf of the landlord. This will be based on the results of the reference and affordability checks.
Organizing reservation fees and bond lodgement - collecting the funds from the tenant and securing the rental bond as per local regulations.
Lease preparation - this is a crucial task involving the property managers who will draft and review the lease agreement. The document will ensure that all legal requirements and terms are reflected. Your offshore team can prepare the Tenancy Agreement on your behalf. They will also make sure to input all tenant details in your real estate management software before the move-in date.
Incoming inspection &  preparing incoming condition report - Prior to tenant move-in, an incoming inspection will be conducted. Property managers will prepare an incoming condition report and note any existing damages or issues.
Saving all tenant files into the system - for organizing the records, all important files will be stored for easy access.

In Tenancy
This phase involves consistent communication with tenants and handling repairs and maintenance. Effective tenant communication is essential throughout the tenancy period. This is so that property managers can promptly address any concerns raised by tenants. Check out the tasks that you can outsource during the in-tenancy process:

Arrears Management - this involves payment reminders and formal notices. This includes monitoring rent payments and taking action to address arrears. 
Maintenance and repairs - to ensure that the property remains in good condition, property managers respond to maintenance requests from tenants. 
Periodic Inspections - to assess the property's condition during the tenancy, periodic inspections are conducted.  
Lease renewals - property managers communicate with tenants to discuss lease renewal options. This will ensure a seamless transition from one tenancy term to another.
Rent Reviews - these are conducted to assess and adjust the rental price based on market conditions and other factors.
Termination of tenancy - in compliance with applicable laws and lease agreements, termination may be necessary. This involves returning keys and security deposit.

An outgoing inspection will also be conducted upon the tenant's vacate. This report will be compared to the incoming inspection report to assess tenant liability for damages. It will also indicate any deductions from the rental bond before refunding.

Construction Outsourcing and Property Development Strategies in the Philippines: Boosting Efficiency and Cost Savings
Construction and property development companies are increasingly turning to outsourcing as a strategic approach to streamline operations, reduce costs, and accelerate project timelines. By delegating specialized tasks to external experts, these companies can focus on their core competencies while benefiting from the expertise and cost-effectiveness of outsourcing partners. In this article, we will explore the benefits of construction outsourcing and property development strategies, with a particular focus on the Philippines as an outsourcing destination.

Tasks that Construction and Property Development Companies Can Outsource
Contract Administration
Managing contracts is a complex task that requires legal expertise. By outsourcing contract administration, companies can ensure legal protection without the need for an in-house legal team. This allows them to focus on their core business activities while ensuring compliance and risk mitigation.

Off the Plan Marketing
Marketing properties that are yet to be constructed, also known as "off the plan" marketing, requires a different approach. Specialized agencies can create virtual tours and high-quality marketing materials that allow prospective buyers to visualize the final product. Outsourcing off the plan marketing ensures professional and compelling marketing campaigns that attract pre-sale interest.

Sales Support
Sales are vital to the success of construction and property development projects. By outsourcing tasks like lead management and customer relationship management (CRM), companies can ensure a professional and consistent approach to sales without the need for in-house resources. This allows them to focus on strategic tasks while maintaining a strong sales presence.

Handling Property Enquiry
Customer inquiries often require immediate attention, but handling them internally can be time-consuming. Outsourced call centers or AI-based chatbots can efficiently filter and handle customer inquiries, passing on only those that require specialized attention. This ensures prompt and effective customer service without overwhelming internal resources.

Property Research
The success of a property development project relies heavily on thorough research. Specialized research firms can provide valuable insights into market trends, site feasibility, and regulatory landscapes. By outsourcing property research, companies can access expert knowledge and mitigate risks associated with inadequate research.

Project Management
Construction and development projects involve numerous moving parts that require careful coordination. Outsourcing project management to specialized firms ensures that projects stay on schedule and within budget, allowing the main company to focus on strategic tasks and overall project strategy.

Graphic Design
The visual representation of a project is crucial in attracting clients and buyers. Graphic design agencies can create compelling visual assets such as logos, branding materials, and architectural renderings. By outsourcing graphic design, companies can ensure professional and visually appealing presentations that leave a lasting impression.

Property Advertising
Advertising is a highly specialized area that requires expertise in media buying and copywriting. Media buying agencies can help companies get the most value out of their advertising budgets, while copywriters can craft messages that resonate with the target audience. Outsourcing property advertising ensures effective and targeted marketing campaigns.

Social Media Marketing
Maintaining a consistent and engaging social media presence is essential in today's digital age. Content creation agencies can handle social media management, creating and posting content that resonates with the target audience. By outsourcing social media marketing, companies can benefit from a professional online presence without the need for day-to-day management.

Coordinating with Local Councils
Navigating the bureaucracy of local councils can be complicated and time-consuming. Hiring liaison officers or external firms that specialize in coordinating with local councils can expedite the process of obtaining necessary permits and approvals. Outsourcing this task ensures efficient communication and compliance with local regulations.

In summary, outsourcing specialized tasks in construction and property development allows companies to focus on their core competencies while benefiting from the expertise and cost-effectiveness of external partners. By outsourcing tasks such as contract administration, off the plan marketing, sales support, property research, project management, graphic design, property advertising, social media marketing, and coordinating with local councils, companies can optimize efficiency, reduce costs, and accelerate project timelines.


Construction and Property Development Roles Outsourceable to the Philippines
The Philippines has emerged as a popular destination for outsourcing due to its skilled workforce, English proficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Construction and property development companies can tap into this resource for various roles based on their specific needs:

Contract Administration: Legal assistants and procurement specialists can handle contract review, drafting, and vendor selection.
Off the Plan Marketing: 3D artists and digital marketers specialize in creating virtual tours and targeted campaigns to attract pre-sale interest.
Sales Support: Telesales agents and CRM administrators are skilled in lead management and customer engagement.
Handling Property Enquiry: Customer service representatives and chatbot developers efficiently manage inbound calls, emails, and chats.
Property Research: Market researchers and regulatory compliance analysts provide valuable insights into market trends and regulatory landscapes.
Project Management: Project coordinators and quality assurance specialists ensure projects stay on schedule and deliver high-quality results.
Graphic Design: Graphic designers and UI/UX designers create visually appealing branding materials and project presentations.
Property Advertising: Copywriters and media buying agents craft compelling ads and maximize advertising budgets.
Social Media Marketing: Social media managers and content creators maintain a consistent and engaging online presence.
Coordinating with Local Councils: Liaison officers and public relations specialists navigate the bureaucracy of local councils and obtain necessary permits and approvals.

By outsourcing these roles to the Philippines, construction and property development companies can access a skilled workforce at a lower cost, ensuring efficient operations and high-quality outputs.

Evaluating BPO Providers for Construction and Property Development Outsourcing
When selecting a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) partner for construction and property development outsourcing, it is crucial to consider the following factors:

Sector Expertise
Choose a BPO that has verifiable experience in the construction and property sector. This ensures that the sourced staff have baseline competencies in the field.

Talent Acquisition & Skillsets
Inquire about the BPO's screening mechanisms for new hires. A high-standard recruitment procedure should prioritize individuals with basic know-how in construction and a willingness to undergo further training.

Interpersonal Abilities
Effective communication and critical thinking skills are essential for remote work, particularly in the construction and property sector. Prioritize BPOs that emphasize these traits in their hiring process.

Technological Capabilities
Confirm that the BPO's hardware capabilities are reliable and meet your project's needs, whether it's CAD software or project management tools. Additionally, ensure that the sourced staff can navigate the software tools you currently utilize or plan to implement.

Operational Setting
Clarify where the outsourced staff will be located. This will influence not just training logistics but also how you intend to manage the team.

Governance & Oversight
Determine the available platforms for regular interactions between you and the outsourced team, especially those that facilitate easy transfer of training material and feedback. Inquire if the BPO offers supervisory assistance or if the management of the outsourced team is your sole responsibility.

Legal & Contractual Clauses
Make sure the agreement is unambiguous concerning the duties and responsibilities you will undertake, notably training. Verify that the contract is accommodating, permitting you to adjust the size of the outsourced team or modify services according to changing requirements.

Reputational Aspects
Look for a BPO that has garnered favorable reviews for professionalism, adherence to quality standards, and the efficacy of their recruitment practices. Customer testimonials can provide valuable insights into the BPO's reputation and reliability.

By carefully evaluating these factors, construction and property development companies can select a BPO partner that aligns with their strategic goals and ensures successful outsourcing outcomes.

Construction and Property Development Outsourcing vs. Offshoring to BPOs
While construction and property development outsourcing and offshoring to BPOs may seem similar, there are key distinctions between the two approaches:

Construction and Property Development Outsourcing
Task-Oriented: Outsourcing typically focuses on specific tasks or projects, such as environmental assessments or site surveys.
Skill-Centric: Outsourcing often targets specific skills that may be lacking in-house, such as cost estimation or zoning law expertise.
Arm's Length Engagement: External contributors may not deeply integrate with the client's team, offering a more detached form of collaboration.
Short to Mid-Range Timeframe: Outsourcing tends to cater to immediate needs but can extend depending on the project's scope.
Geographical Flexibility: Outsourcing can take place within the same country or internationally, depending on skill availability and budget constraints.
Expertise Assumed: Outsourced workers are expected to be self-sufficient with little need for training.
Billing Mechanisms: Payment often corresponds to project milestones or specific outputs.
Oversight Level: Client involvement in project management can vary but usually adheres to pre-defined project scopes.

Construction and Property Development Offshoring to BPOs
Staff-Centric: BPOs usually offer part-time or full-time staff dedicated solely to the client's needs.
Broad Service Spectrum: BPO employees can manage an array of functions from basic clerical tasks to specialized construction-related responsibilities.
Highly Integrated: BPO employees closely align with the client's existing workforce, sharing tools, data, and communication platforms.
Long-Term Collaboration: Offshoring is generally better suited for ongoing, perpetual needs rather than one-off projects.
Geographical Constraints: Offshoring involves sending work to countries with more affordable labor costs.
Client-Provided Training: The onus of specialized training often lies with the client.
Retainer-Based Costs: Payments are often structured as ongoing fees, depending on the number of employees engaged.
Hands-On Management: Clients usually play an active role in team oversight, especially when specialized training is needed.

The choice between construction and property development outsourcing and offshoring to BPOs depends on project requirements, desired level of integration, and long-term collaboration goals.

Estimating the cost benefits:

Domestic Construction Planner Salary: In the United States, a construction planner can earn between $70,000 and $110,000 annually, excluding additional expenses.
BPO Construction Planner Salary: An equivalent role in a Philippine BPO might come with an annual salary ranging from $10,000 to $15,000, inclusive of overheads.

Basic Calculations: Outsourcing construction planning can result in approximate cost savings between $60,000 and $100,000 per year.

Additional financial benefits:

Resource Expenditure: Savings also come in the form of reduced operational costs like office rent and utilities.
Time Efficiency: Cutting back on time devoted to human resource tasks like recruiting and training.
Adaptability: Enhanced flexibility in scaling operations, avoiding commitments tied to local employment.
Accelerated Project Turnaround: With a bolstered workforce, projects can often be completed in a shorter timeframe, boosting competitive advantage.

Legal Process Outsourcing for Conveyancing Firms
The complex tasks associated with real estate settlement and closing processes make it difficult for firms to streamline their operations. Not to mention the challenges of maintaining client satisfaction and the associated costs of hiring in-person staff. As property markets thrive in the industry, the need for real estate outsourcing services becomes the ultimate solution.

Particularly, the function of a conveyancer is crucial in ensuring that the settlement and closing process is efficient and valid. From title searches to guiding clients through legal implications, they specialize in overseeing real estate transactions.

While hiring an in-person staff for this function is an option, there are also operational & staffing costs to consider. Fortunately, the digital era has conveniently made outsourcing conveyancers easier for a legally sound transfer of property ownership. In fact, hiring a conveyancer along with a proficient virtual transaction coordinator can even expedite the closing process further.

The primary advantage of outsourcing is that you can focus on your core duties to improve your business. You can simply delegate tasks to a virtual assistant or even create a workforce to streamline your overall operations. This article will cover the duties, advantages, cost analysis of outsourcing conveyancing services, and more.

The Function of Conveyancers in Real Estate Transactions
Conveyancers are essential in streamlining and expediting real estate transactions. Their expertise allows a seamless and legally compliant transfer of property ownership. Here are some of the valuable contributions of conveyancers in every real estate transaction:

Due Diligence - Adhering to local regulations requires conveyancers to investigate the property's title history. This process helps identify any potential legal issues that may occur and guarantees a smooth process.
Detailed Review of Legal Documents - Conveyancers draft and review each legal document to ensure accuracy. This includes contracts, agreements, and transfer deeds which reflect the terms of the transaction.
Risk Reduction - Carefully examining potential legal pitfalls, conveyancers scrutinize issues such as unpaid taxes or property restrictions like zoning. Their role is to minimize the risks and potential disputes and comply with the legal requirements.
Communication & Collaboration - Conveyancers act as intermediaries between buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and other stakeholders. They ensure the involvement of all concerned parties by coordinating with them in the process.
Title Transfer and Settlement - When everything is ready, conveyancers ensure the successful transfer of the property. They also manage funds, ensure proper document delivery, and guarantee property transfer to the new owner.

For corporations engaged in property transactions, outsourcing to a trusted conveyancing firm can optimize efficiency. This enables them to concentrate on their core business while experts manage legal intricacies. Similarly, law firms specializing in other areas of law might outsource conveyancing services to real estate law experts.

You can also outsource a conveyancer and delegate payment-related tasks such as stamp duty and taxation. Working alongside a property bookkeeper can also efficiently manage the financial aspects of property transactions.

Advantages of Outsourcing Conveyancers
The overhead costs and recruitment process associated with hiring in-person conveyancers can be challenging. Imagine that instead of focusing on major tasks, you need to spend time on hiring that may not be your expertise.

You may also need to pay higher overhead costs for an in-person staff which can strain your budget. The good news is that outsourcing is an excellent alternative to this traditional hiring process. Let's take a look at some of the perks to help you make the best decisions for your business:

Optimize Finances - Opting for outsourced conveyancers is ideal for a cost-efficient solution. Particularly in countries offering low labor costs like the Philippines, you can expect to pay less and save more.

For instance, the price of hiring a virtual assistant costs three times more in other first-world countries. This includes the USA, Australia, and UK among others. Whereas if you outsource in the Philippines, you can even potentially hire 2-3 workers for the price of one.

Access to Expertise - If you're looking to access a talent pool of professionals, outsourcing is definitely the answer. There are plenty of skilled individuals with extensive knowledge of property law that can guarantee successful completion of tasks.

However, it is still necessary to train your outsourced staff on your daily processes in order to meet your goals. For instance, outsourced staff may not be familiar with city-specific regulations and requirements. You may also need to spend time on familiarizing them with local laws.

Improve Process Efficiency - Virtual conveyancers are experts in risk mitigation strategies. They help minimize the chances of errors and legal issues which can cost your business more.

Through outsourcing, you can also streamline the conveyancing process by leveraging advanced technologies. This includes using cloud-based software for document management for a more organized transaction.

Focus on Core Duties - By outsourcing non-core activities like conveyancing, you can allocate more time and resources to your primary business functions. This can significantly improve your overall competitiveness and market positioning.

At the same time, inquiries from existing and potential clients will not go unnoticed. As you work on the major tasks that fuel the business, you can delegate client inquiries to your virtual conveyancer.

Flexibility of Workload - Outsourcing providers can customize conveyancing services to align with the specific requirements of each transaction. This allows flexibility and easy scaling up or down based on workload fluctuations.

During peak periods, such as high real estate transaction seasons, outsourcing allows you to scale up your conveyancing operations. You no longer need to hire more staff as this flexibility can help you manage fluctuations in demand more effectively.

The expertise of legal process outsourcing companies streamlines processes, reduces the risk of errors, and accelerates transaction timelines. This allows stakeholders to allocate their resources wisely. Not only will you be focusing on core activities, but also benefit from the specialized knowledge of conveyancing experts.

In-House Conveyancers vs Outsourcing through BPO Agency
In this section, we will feature expert insights on outsourcing options to help you make the best decision. Continue reading to learn more about hiring in-house conveyancers vs outsourcing through a real estate BPO agency like ShoreAgents.

Hiring an in-house conveyancing team can be more expensive depending on various factors. Their overall work experience is one factor, but the location majorly affects the overall salary.

If you hire locally, you will need to consider the median wage for the role. For instance, the average annual salary of a property assessor in the USA costs approximately $62,860 USD. This excludes benefits, office space, and equipment. Not to mention other costs associated with recruitment and training, which can be burdensome.

Whereas if you outsource in the Philippines, you can expect to pay $19, 537 USD annually. This already includes the salary, office space, facilities and equipment, health benefits, and our fees at ShoreAgents.

During seasons with a low volume of transactions, it can be challenging to keep in-person staff on the payroll. Considering that they offer higher fixed costs compared to outsourcing through a real estate BPO firm like ShoreAgents.

Outsourced staff members can also easily scale based on demand and offers long-term cost analysis. Apart from having access to global talent, you can enjoy established systems. You no longer need to invest in real estate software and tools which requires more costs. 

Factors to Consider when Selecting an Outsourcing Agency
When considering where to avail legal process outsourcing services, it’s important to conduct thorough research. Look for firms or professionals with the following:

Strong track record - Outsourcing firms with a strong track record give assurance that they have a history of successful collaborations. This simply presents years of expertise in their field to deliver high-quality staffing services.
Positive client reviews - It's true what they say about how reviews speak for the company itself. Positive insights from clients reflect a firm's established reputation and commitment to satisfying customers. 
Relevant expertise - Industry-specific knowledge is very important as it impacts the success of your projects. Partnering with an outsourcing agency with relevant experience guarantees that the staff you onboard are familiar with the industry trends. At the same time, they can offer the best practices and solutions that align with your business objectives.
Transparent pricing structures - Providing a detailed breakdown of costs showcases professionalism and builds trust. This also helps your firm to strategize in financial planning and decision-making. 

At ShoreAgents, we provide the best real estate staffing solutions for the real estate industry. Our success team demonstrates a commitment to excellence that translates into tangible results. With our fruitful years in the real estate industry, we value client satisfaction and understand your outsourcing needs. Whether you need to hire one agent, build a team, or create a workforce - we have you covered.

Where to Avail Outsourcing Conveyancing Services?
Several businesses turn to outsourcing conveyancing services due to the various advantages they offer. We already know that it can potentially save you money, but what are the available alternatives? Let's take a look at the expert insights below to help you make an informed outsourcing decision. 

Freelance Conveyancers
These are independent experts that provide freelance conveyancing services. While this can yield cost savings, it's crucial to thoroughly validate their credentials and previous work experience. 

You should also think about the possibility that hiring a freelancer could cost more. The current trend of freelancing has resulted in higher competition, so they may demand higher rates for their services.

Even when you're considering hiring a virtual assistant in the Philippines, it might turn out to be considerably more expensive. Take, for instance, our offer at ShoreAgents for a full-time real estate virtual assistant costs $1,191 USD per month. Hiring a full-time freelancer can potentially incur higher costs which can be around $2,720 USD per month.

The hourly rate for a Philippine-based conveyancing virtual assistant is $17 USD. Assuming that the freelancer works 40 hours per week full-time, the weekly cost would be $680 USD. This excludes additional expenses like statutory government benefits and insurance.

Most importantly, freelancers are not dedicated to your business alone. They usually work on different projects at the same time so their turnaround time may be slower. 

In addition to this, training can be more complex if they only have minimal work experience in the industry. You can certainly find the best candidate with relevant experience but will need to spend time reviewing all the applications. 

Real Estate BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) Firm
With BPO firms, you benefit from a structured workflow and consistent quality control. This may be lacking when you rely on individual freelancers who might have varying work styles and standards.

Essentially, real estate BPO firms like ShoreAgents offer customized solutions to your changing business needs. We can also adjust our resources to match transaction volumes during peak periods.

You no longer need to worry about investing in technology tools, as your offshore team already utilizes them. As well as overhead costs involving office space and work equipment? We also have that covered for your outsourced staff.

ShoreAgents is a real estate BPO firm that offers a wealth of industry-specific expertise. Our proven track record of successful real estate staffing can proudly offer the best candidates you can find in the market.

You no longer need to spend time on tedious recruitment duties and wonder whether or not you hired the right candidate. All you have to do is pinpoint the role and tasks to delegate and we take care of the rest.

This includes candidate search, assessment, interview, onboarding, and staff engagement. Our success team will assist during the interview process to ensure that you're onboarding the best among the rest. Outsourcing through a real estate BPO agency offers a more streamlined process that outshines freelancers.

Conclusion
To sum up, legal processing outsourcing for conveyancers presents a strategic strategy for effectively navigating the complex realm of property transactions. The decision to outsource signifies a commitment to optimizing resources and ensuring that property transactions unfold seamlessly.

ShoreAgents offers expert real estate staffing assistance. Our success team provides comprehensive support services across membership tiers to ensure a fruitful outsourcing journey for your organization.

So, if you're looking to streamline your estimating processes, save costs, and achieve better project outcomes, read on!

Why Outsource Estimating Services?
When it comes to estimating, many companies struggle to strike the right balance between accuracy and efficiency. Hiring an in-house team of estimators can be costly and time-consuming, especially when you consider the recruitment, training, and ongoing management involved. This is where outsourcing estimating services can be a game-changer.
 
By outsourcing estimating services, you can tap into a pool of experienced professionals who specialize in construction estimation. These professionals are well-versed in the latest industry trends, software, and methodologies. They bring a fresh perspective and can offer valuable insights that can enhance the accuracy and reliability of your estimates.
 
Outsourcing also allows you to scale your estimating capabilities quickly and efficiently. Whether you need to ramp up your estimating efforts for a large project or scale down during quieter periods, outsourcing provides the flexibility to adapt to changing demands without the need for extensive hiring processes.
 
The Scope of Outsourcing Estimating
When you opt for outsourcing estimating services, you have the opportunity to cover a wide range of aspects related to construction estimation. From preliminary cost estimates to detailed takeoffs, outsourcing can handle it all. Here are some common areas that can be covered when you outsource your estimating needs:
 
Preliminary Cost Estimates: Outsourcing can help you develop accurate cost estimates during the early stages of a project. This includes assessing the feasibility of a project, estimating costs based on initial drawings and specifications, and providing valuable insights for decision-making.
Detailed Takeoffs: Takeoffs involve quantifying and measuring the materials and labor required for a project. By outsourcing this task, you can ensure accurate takeoffs that consider all the necessary components, reducing the risk of over- or under-estimating.
Quantity Surveys: Quantity surveys involve measuring and quantifying the materials needed for a project. This includes everything from bricks and concrete to electrical wiring and plumbing fixtures. By outsourcing quantity surveys, you can ensure accurate material procurement and minimize wastage.
Value Engineering: Value engineering is the process of optimizing the cost and value of a project. By outsourcing this aspect of estimating, you can leverage the expertise of professionals who have a deep understanding of construction materials and methods. They can suggest alternative approaches and materials that can help you achieve cost savings without compromising on quality.
Bid Preparation: Outsourcing bid preparation can save you time and effort. Estimators can help you develop comprehensive and competitive bids that take into account all the necessary factors, such as labor costs, materials, subcontractor quotes, and profit margins.
 
Outsourcing Construction Estimating: A Game Changer
Outsourcing construction estimating can be a game changer for your business. It can speed up the construction process, enhance accuracy and reliability, and ultimately lead to better project outcomes. Let's explore how outsourcing can bring these benefits to your construction projects.
 
Speeding up the Construction Process
 Time is of the essence in the construction industry. Delays can lead to increased costs, missed deadlines, and dissatisfied clients. By outsourcing your estimating needs, you can expedite the construction process in several ways:
 
Quick Turnaround Times: Outsourcing companies have dedicated teams of estimators who can focus solely on your project. This allows for faster turnaround times, ensuring that estimates are delivered promptly.
Scalability: Outsourcing provides the flexibility to scale your estimating team up or down as needed. Whether you have a sudden influx of projects or need to streamline during quieter periods, outsourcing allows you to adapt quickly to changing demands.
Access to Specialized Expertise: Outsourcing companies often have a diverse talent pool with specialized expertise in different areas of construction estimation. This means you can access professionals who have deep knowledge and experience in specific sectors, such as electrical estimating or civil engineering.
 
Enhancing Accuracy and Reliability
Accurate estimating is vital for project success. It ensures that costs are properly allocated, materials are procured in the right quantities, and timelines are realistic. When you outsource your estimating needs, you can benefit from the following:
 
Industry Best Practices: Estimating professionals who work for outsourcing companies are well-versed in the latest industry best practices. They stay up-to-date with the latest trends, software, and methodologies, ensuring that your estimates are accurate and reliable.
Quality Control: Outsourcing companies have robust quality control processes in place to ensure the accuracy and reliability of their estimates. This includes thorough checks, reviews, and cross-referencing to minimize errors and inconsistencies.
Independent Perspective: By outsourcing your estimating needs, you can gain an independent perspective on your projects. Estimators who are not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of your company can provide valuable insights and identify potential blind spots or areas for improvement.
 
The Significance of Outsource Electrical Estimating Service
