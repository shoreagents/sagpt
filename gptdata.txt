Q: How to evaluate architecture outsourcing service providers?
A: When you're considering a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) company specializing in architecture, you're looking for a partner that can offer full-time, dedicated staff to act as an extension of your in-house team. Here are some criteria you might consider to evaluate such a BPO provider: Specialization in Architecture
Industry Familiarity: The BPO should still have some degree of familiarity with architectural services to better match you with candidates who have the foundational skills you require.
Recruitment and Skill Set
Recruitment Process: Inquire about how the BPO recruits talent. Look for a stringent selection process that focuses on foundational skills and learning aptitude, given that you'll be providing specialized training.
Soft Skills: Consider candidates' communication skills, problem-solving abilities, and other soft skills that will make remote collaboration more effective.
Infrastructure and Equipment
Hardware: The BPO should provide reliable computer systems, high-speed internet, and other essential hardware.
Software: Make sure that the staff has access to basic software tools and can easily integrate with any specialized tools you'll be providing or requiring them to use.
Work Environment
Work-From-Home vs Office: Understand whether the staff will be working from home or an office setting. This may affect your training logistics and oversight capabilities.
Management and Oversight
Communication Channels: Determine the tools and procedures for communication between you and the remote staff. These should allow for effective training sessions.
Supervision: If you’re responsible for training and oversight, check if the BPO will provide any managerial assistance or if you’ll need to manage the remote team directly.
Contractual Aspects
Contract Clarity: The contract should be crystal clear on your roles and responsibilities, particularly that you will be responsible for training.
Flexibility and Scalability: Ensure that the contract allows for adjustments, whether it's scaling the team size or changing services, to meet your evolving needs.
Reviews and Reputation
Client Feedback: Even if you are providing the training, you still want a BPO with positive client feedback, particularly on professionalism, reliability, and the quality of their foundational recruitment.
Since you'll be taking on the responsibility for training, the selection process should focus more on foundational skills and adaptability, along with a strong willingness to learn. The BPO's role becomes more of a facilitator, providing you with a shortlist of candidates who meet your criteria, along with the necessary infrastructure for them to work effectively.

Q: What are architecture Outsourced services? VS Architecture Offshoring to a BPO?
A: Both architecture outsourced services and architecture offshoring to a BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) involve contracting work to third-party providers. However, there are key differences in terms of the scope of work, level of integration with the client company, and other logistical aspects. Here's how they generally differ:
Architecture Outsourced Services
Project-Based: Usually, outsourced services are contracted for specific projects or tasks. You may outsource 3D modeling for a particular project, for instance.
Skill-Specific: Outsourcing often focuses on specialized skills, like rendering or structural analysis, that the client company may not possess or want to maintain in-house.
Less Integration: Outsourced workers typically operate more independently and may not integrate deeply into the client's internal team or culture.
Short- to Medium-term: Outsourcing is often used for short-term needs, although it can be extended based on project requirements.
Varied Locations: Outsourcing can happen locally, nationally, or internationally.
Limited Training: Companies usually expect outsourced service providers to be experts in their fields and require minimal training.
Costing: Generally billed by project milestones or deliverables, although this can vary.
Ownership and Oversight: The level of ownership and oversight can be more distant, often dictated by a clear scope of work or project requirements.
Examples: Freelance CAD drafters, rendering services, structural engineering consultants.
Architecture Offshoring to BPO
Full-time Staffing: BPO usually provides full-time or part-time dedicated staff who work solely for your company.
Broader Scope: BPO staff can handle a wide variety of roles, from administrative tasks to more specialized architectural work.
High Integration: Since BPO staff are like an extension of your team, they often integrate more closely with your in-house staff.
Long-term: BPO is generally more suited for long-term and ongoing needs.
Specific Locations: Offshoring implies that the BPO is located in another country, typically where labor costs are lower.
Client-led Training: Often, the client is responsible for training the BPO staff, particularly for specialized tasks or company-specific software.
Costing: Usually involves a retainer or ongoing fee, often based on the number of full-time employees provided.
Ownership and Oversight: Typically requires a more hands-on approach, especially if the client is providing training and oversight.
Examples: Remote teams handling a range of tasks from CAD drafting, data entry, project management to client relations.
In summary, architecture outsourced services are often more project-specific and can be more hands-off, while architecture offshoring to a BPO often involves a more integrated, long-term relationship with full-time or part-time staff. Your choice between the two would depend on your firm's specific needs, the level of expertise required, and how much direct oversight and training you are willing or able to provide.

Q: How can an Architecture company prepare for Outsourcing to the Philippines? 
A: Outsourcing architectural services to a specialized BPO like ShoreAgents in the Philippines can provide efficiency, cost savings, and access to a vast talent pool. For a seamless transition and integration, an architecture company should take the following steps:
1. Define Clear Objectives
Understand why you're outsourcing. Is it to save on costs, tap into specialized talent, scale operations, or all the above?
Identify specific roles and tasks you intend to delegate, such as CAD drafting, 3D modeling, project management, or administrative support.
2. Engage in Due Diligence
Research the BPO's expertise, especially in the architectural domain. ShoreAgents, for example, has experience with real estate and may have unique insights into architectural support.
Request case studies, client testimonials, or references from the BPO.
3. Establish Communication Protocols
Time zone differences can be challenging. Plan regular check-ins that work for both parties.
Decide on the communication tools (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Slack) that will be used.
4. Technical Alignment
Ensure that software and tools used by the BPO align with those of your company. For architectural tasks, this could include tools like AutoCAD, Revit, 3ds Max, etc.
Discuss data transfer methods, ensuring they are secure and efficient.
5. Training & Onboarding
Even if the BPO provides trained staff, you may need to acquaint them with your company's specific processes, software customizations, or design standards.
Develop an onboarding package that includes training materials, company guidelines, and any other essential resources.
6. Pilot Project
Before fully committing, run a pilot project with the BPO. This allows you to evaluate their service quality, adherence to deadlines, and communication efficiency.
Based on the pilot's outcomes, refine your collaboration approach.
7. Data Security & IP Protection
Discuss and ensure the implementation of robust data protection measures. Architectural designs and client data can be sensitive.
Draft Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and ensure the BPO's employees also adhere to them.
8. Legal & Contractual Agreements
Develop a clear Service Level Agreement (SLA) that defines the scope of work, timelines, quality standards, and other deliverables.
Ensure the contract covers aspects like dispute resolution, payment terms, and exit strategy.
9. Performance Metrics & Feedback
Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the BPO's performance.
Regularly review these metrics and provide feedback. A continuous feedback loop ensures ongoing improvement.
10. Cultural Integration
The Philippines has its own rich culture and traditions. Understanding and respecting these can enhance the working relationship.
Encourage cultural exchange sessions where teams from both sides can share and learn about each other's work cultures.
11. Review & Scale
Periodically review the relationship, performance, and outcomes.
If the partnership is productive, consider scaling up the tasks or roles outsourced to the BPO.
By diligently following these steps, an architecture company can ensure a smooth, productive, and long-term collaboration with a BPO like ShoreAgents in the Philippines.

Q: How much Can your Architecture Firm or Company Save by Outsourcing to a BPO Philippines?
A: The amount an architecture firm or company can save by outsourcing to a BPO in the Philippines can vary widely depending on several factors. Here are some elements to consider when calculating potential savings:
Factors Affecting Cost Savings
Scope of Outsourcing: What roles and tasks are you outsourcing? Specialized roles like architects and project managers will be more costly compared to administrative tasks.
Volume: The number of staff you're planning to hire through the BPO will also affect overall costs and savings.
Local Costs: Consider your current or projected local costs for the roles you plan to outsource. This includes salaries, benefits, overhead, and any additional costs such as recruitment and training.
BPO Costs: Find out the full cost structure of the BPO, including any hidden fees or costs for additional services like training or special projects.
Quality and Expertise: Higher-skilled labor may cost more but can provide better quality work, potentially increasing the overall value and long-term savings.
Sample Calculation
Here is a simple comparison based on labor costs:
Local Architect Salary: The average salary for an architect in the U.S. can range from $60,000 to $100,000 per year, not including benefits and overhead costs like office space, utilities, hardware, and software.
BPO Architect Salary: In contrast, the average salary for an architect in the Philippines can range from $8,000 to $12,000 per year, including all overheads if you go through a BPO.
Additional Costs: Add on recruitment fees, software licenses, and other overheads to get a more comprehensive picture.
Potential Savings:
At the simplest level, you could save anywhere from $52,000 to $92,000 per year per architect by outsourcing, not accounting for any additional costs or variations in job roles.
This is a rough estimate and actual savings can vary. However, many firms find they can save up to 60%-70% by outsourcing various roles to the Philippines.
Other Savings
Operational Costs: Savings on office space, utilities, and other resources.
Time: Reduced time spent on HR activities like recruitment, payroll, and training.
Flexibility: Easier to scale operations up or down without the long-term commitments required for local hires.
Reduced Time-to-Market: With a larger workforce, projects can potentially be completed faster, providing a competitive edge.
It's important to perform a thorough cost-benefit analysis to get an accurate picture of potential savings tailored to your specific situation. Even after considering all these factors, most companies find that outsourcing to a BPO in the Philippines offers significant cost advantages.

By following these steps, you can lay the groundwork for a successful and mutually beneficial partnership with ShoreAgents for your architectural needs.
