Writing Perspective
First Person (I, We): This perspective allows me to write as if I am the narrator, sharing personal experiences, thoughts, and feelings. It's useful for creating a sense of intimacy and immediacy.
Second Person (You): Less common, this perspective directly addresses the reader as "you," making them a participant in the text. It's often used in instructional writing or to create a unique narrative style.
Third Person Limited: Here, I write from the perspective of an outside observer focusing on the experiences and thoughts of a specific character. This allows for a deep exploration of a character's inner world while maintaining narrative control.
Third Person Omniscient: In this perspective, I write as an all-knowing narrator who can describe the thoughts and actions of any character in the story. This allows for a broad and comprehensive view of the narrative.
Objective/Narrative: This is a detached perspective where I present actions and dialogue without delving into the thoughts or feelings of the characters. It's like a camera recording events.
Multiple Perspectives: I can also alternate between different characters' viewpoints, offering a multi-faceted understanding of the narrative or topic.
Impersonal/Analytical: For factual, informational, or analytical content, I adopt an impersonal tone, focusing on the subject matter without personal bias or narrative.

HOW IT WORKS
How Our Recruitment Works
You submit a job description of what you are looking for.
The job description you create should include all duties for your new team member to perform in a bulleted list. Ideally, your tasks will not be too difficult and may be repetitive.
We start the search
Our candidate searches are conducted using at least 10 sources that include job sites, job advertisements, social media, referrals, and our own database of more than 25,000 potential candidates.
We filter and test worker candidates
Our high-tech filtering methods select candidates for you that we feel are most suitable for your role. We then can qualify these candidates using typing, English and aptitude tests that we’ve developed.
You interview qualifying candidates and select the one you like best.
Out of the pool of endorsed candidates that we present to you, you’re free to interview any or all of them to select the new team member you like best.
We onboard and they start working for you
Once you’ve selected the winning candidate, we’ll formalize their job offer and onboard them, and they’ll start working for you. We’ll be thoroughly involved in their first days of working for you, and our staff will be ready to address any obstacles or difficulties that they or you may encounter from those days going forward.

How Does Staff Management Work?
Be ready for day 1
Access
ShoreAgents confirms that every team member that’s brought aboard has access to the digital and analog resources that will enable their success.

Communication
ShoreAgents makes sure that team members communicate with clients as openly, honestly and often as possible to allow work to be executed efficiently, punctually and industriously.

What Standard Support Services Do We Provide?
Equipment
We provide a complete PC equipped with dual monitors, a webcam and a communications headset for all team members.
Management
Our staff functions as onsite managers, making sure the work gets done every hour, day and week. We make sure all issues, eventualities and emergencies are handled and dealt with as quickly and professionally as possible.
Performance
Our staff and support infrastructure measures worker performance so that goals can be reached and workers can be rewarded for extra effort.
HR and Legals
ShoreAgents handles all Human Resources support for your remote workers via a web-accessible HR hub, including panels for logged hours, employment contracts, leave requests, worker tardiness, etc. ShoreAgents also handles all legal aspects of worker employment.
Payroll
ShoreAgents takes care of payroll for your remote team members, including accounting for benefits and local charges, overtime/undertime, etc. All team members are given a standard bank debit card, so they can be paid. You’ll receive one simple invoice from ShoreAgents, and we’ll handle everything else.
IT Support
We have a full IT division that monitors and updates all hardware, software and network services.
Staff Engagement
We make sure your remote team members are kept happy and engaged, by celebrating work anniversaries and birthdays, providing activity clubs and monthly games, supplying free coffee and subsidized food and giving out monthly awards like employee of the month plus more.
Internet
We maintain high-speed Internet over multiple connections for all team members in our office.
Workstation
We provide a clean, fully outfitted workstation for every team member to work at.

Success Team

Staff and Client Coaching
We will work with both your organization and your remote team members to make sure everyone is on the same page regarding work that needs to get done and tasks that need to be accomplished. It’s our goal to remove obstacles and reduce friction in the client-worker relationship to the greatest extent possible.
Advisory Services
Our staff can advise you and your organization about how to best leverage and integrate remote workers, given your business objectives and targets.

What Do You Need To Do To Use Our Services?
Task Allocation
The most important priority is for you to select tasks for your remote workers to perform. These tasks should be clearly defined and preferably not too complex (being repetitive is OK!).
Staff Training
You should determine who in your organization will train your remote team members. Ideally, they will have a deep understanding of what they will be training new team members on and may have trained other staff previously.
Manage KPI's
To get a good idea of how well your remote workers are performing, it’s recommended that you develop and observe key performance indicators (KPIs) you can use to measure success.

We Help Businesses of All Sizes Grow While Reducing Costs. What Does Your Business Need?
One Agent
Businesses that are small or new to outsourcing may want to start with just one agent. Getting comfortable with one agent will set you on the path to growth and potentially hiring additional team members further down the road.
Teams
Businesses that are growing and/or those that have some experience with one remote team member can add additional workers to build a team. Teams can support just one line of business, or several.
Workforce
Larger businesses and/or those that wish to deploy teams across multiple lines of business can build fully remote workforces using ShoreAgents.

Rules of Engagement
We can find you one, some but you can't have none.
We like our clients to be borderline obsessive-compulsive and be highly focused on growth.
It is a must that our clients have a sense of humor, as some mistakes are inevitable along the outsourcing journey — but these are always opportunities for learning.
RECRUITMENT
How Does it Work?
If you’d like to conduct a talent search with us, it’s really simple:
Fill out the Get Started Form
Submit your Job Description
Zoom Call with our team
Our support team will reach out to schedule a quick chat regarding the role you want to hire for.

The reason we do this is that every business is unique, and you’re the one who knows your business best. We’ve been at this long enough to know that a uniform approach doesn’t work for all firms; instead, we want to be 100 percent in-tune with what your needs are, so we can calibrate your expectations for success.

We organize our candidates into four well-defined groups, which are categorized as follows:
Exact Matches
An exact match is a candidate possessing all of the skills you’re looking for, who also has relevant experience and who is even familiar with many of your digital/online tools. These candidates are extremely rare to come across, but when we find them, we take the utmost measures to secure them for you. Keep in mind that candidates with the exact skills you need will typically be in high demand, so their cost will invariably be higher than average.
Transferable Skills
These candidates may not have worked in the exact industry niche your organization lies within, but they possess skills that are transferable. Most tasks that businesses have for remote workers tend to be fairly easy to perform and very teachable. These job candidates are quick learners and will typically get up to speed quickly, as they have previous experience in similar roles. Their cost will be slightly less than that of Exact Matches.
Entry Level
These candidates aren’t new to the workforce, but by the same token, they don’t come with a lot of experience. They’re minimally qualified for most tasks and will require some training to get up to a level where they’ll be useful for your team. Because they’re still getting their feet wet in terms of work experience, their skills and cost will be somewhere between candidates with Transferable Skills and Fresh Graduates.
Fresh Graduates
These candidates are absolutely new to the workforce. In most cases, they’re new university graduates who are extremely hungry to start working and learning. They tend to adapt to new jobs like ducks to water. We’ve had amazing success in placing these candidates, and their rise through the ranks to advanced positions continues to astonish us. The return on investment for firms that believe in these candidates is typically phenomenal. Even better, the cost of a fresh-graduate team member may be roughly half that of an Exact Match.

How Do We Attract Candidates?
We’re plugged into multiple job networks that allow us to select candidates from a diverse array of talented workers. We put more resources into locating worker candidates than we do into the marketing of our firm; after all, our business rests on your success, which, in turn, is enabled by our company delivering the most talented workers we can find.

We locate top talent via:
Our Database of 25,000+ Candidates
Facebook Ads
SMS Alerts
Our Own Referral System
LinkedIn Ads
Active Search
Job Sites
Google Ads
Jobs360
Facebook Groups
Electronic Direct Mail (EDM)
Between all of these sources, we attract more than 1,000 candidates per month. But out of this total, we only accept the top 5 percent of applicants. When we receive a new candidate’s application, we take care of all of the heavy lifting, so you don’t have to.

First, we verify all aspects of a candidate’s resumé to make sure they’re suitable for roles at our company.

Second, we conduct a phone screening with a candidate and allow them to evaluate themselves. We then assess them and grade them on:
Spoken English
Written English
Attitude
Qualifications
Goals
Job Knowledge
Computer Skills
Work History
Typing Speed

If we’re satisfied with these assessments, we’ll invite the candidate to a first-round interview conducted by our success team. We treat this as a formal interview, as it will be presented to you, the client. To save time, we ask many of the normal interview questions you might ask the candidate if you were conducting the interview yourself. Some of these questions will include:
What are your key strengths?
For cases where the client has very few or no tasks to assign to you, how will you handle this scenario?
What steps would you take if you didn’t completely understand a task?
Certain technical issues may arise while you’re working. How will you handle these?
How would you handle cases where the client is not easy to deal with or difficult to communicate with?
How long are you planning to stay with our company if you’re hired?

We welcome your testing of suitable candidates using any tools or methods you prefer. If you don’t have testing tools or methods for candidate evaluation, we’ve developed several of our own.

Our optional secondary filtration methods include the following tests:
Typing Test: Because a client’s tools are digital and online, a fast typing ability is crucial for worker candidates to possess. We can administer a typing test that measures both speed and accuracy.
English Testing: Our English test measures English-language speaking, reading and writing abilities. As English is the common denominator for all our clients, it’s critical that our workers be able to use it properly and be able to parse it accurately, whether it’s written or spoken.
Aptitude Testing: Our aptitude test was developed from more than 30 years’ worth of combined business experience, using business owners’ perspectives. This test allows clients to save time and see in advance how a worker candidate thinks and responds, and where their work ethic lies.

When these tests are administered, for quality purposes, every candidate is manually graded. Based on all the information we’ve gathered and the grading and assessments we’ve made, we endorse candidates we believe would be best suited for your position.

We present all endorsed candidates to you, along with their video introductions and interviews that we’ve already conducted with them. It’s up to you which candidates you would like to select for interviews with your company.

We’ll set up interviews for you with all your chosen candidates. We’ll assist you with these interviews, so we can listen in, help you with your final selection and give you feedback on your decision. But rest assured that the final selection is ultimately yours and yours alone.

Once you’ve made a choice, we’ll send a job offer with the agreed-upon salary to the candidate. Once the candidate accepts the offer, we’ll begin the onboarding process for the specified starting date. We’ll make sure all infrastructure and support programs are ready for the new team member’s first day, and at that point, our staff management takes over handling them.
HIRE ONE AGENT
Chapter 1: The Unique Approach to Recruiting a One-Agent Staff Member for Real Estate Businesses

Recruiting the right virtual staff member for your real estate business requires a unique approach, especially when it comes to hiring a one-agent staff member. At ShoreAgents, we specialize in providing remote staffing solutions to real estate businesses worldwide. In this chapter, we'll guide you through the recruitment process for hiring a one-agent staff member and help you find the right candidate from our pool of 25,000+ real estate-focused candidates.

Creating a Detailed Job Role: The Key to Successful Recruitment of One Agent Staff Members
The first step in recruiting a one-agent staff member is creating a detailed job role. This can be challenging, especially if you're new to the process. However, with the help of tools like Chatgpt, you can make it easier by recording all the necessary tasks and putting them into a formalized job role. When creating a job role, it's essential to document all the tasks your virtual staff member can complete offshore. These are typically tasks that are completed online or over the phone. It's also important to itemize the tasks in a way that's easy to understand and learn for your new staff member.

Understanding the Importance of Detailed Task Documentation and Training Materials for One Agent Recruitment.
As a smaller business, you may have many tasks that could be completed, and the roles could be more diverse. This means that you need to have a larger scope of knowledge across the whole business. Therefore, it's crucial to mark down the difficulty of each task, whether it's easy, medium, or hard, and whether you have any official process for it. When working with a staff member in the Philippines, you need to have training material, process material, and procedures for each of the tasks that they're going to be completing. So it's best to have all these things ready before you even start the recruitment process.

Finding the Right Candidate: Navigating ShoreAgents' Screening and Interview Process
Once you have the job role and tasks documented, it's time to create a work order and look for the right candidate. At ShoreAgents, we are always hiring for similar jobs and have a large database of 25,000+ candidates. There may already be someone suitable for your job in our pool. However, we also advertise across multiple platforms to ensure we attract the right candidate. Once we attract candidates, we filter and test all of them for you. We run them through some basic screening, and if they pass and we think they'll be suitable for your job role, we'll offer them a company interview.

The Unique Company Interview Process for Hiring One Agent Staff Members at ShoreAgents
Our company interview process is unique and saves you time. It's conducted by our success team, and we record it for you to review. This way, you can quickly see who you want to formally interview. It's especially useful when hiring someone for an on-the-phone role, as you'll hear how they speak and communicate. We then endorse a group of candidates to you who we think are suitable for the role, and you make your decision of who to interview.

Finalizing the Hiring Process for Your One Agent Virtual Staff Member
Once you've conducted the interviews and selected the right candidate, our team will reach out to them and book a zoom call with you, the candidate, and whoever needs to be on the call from your business. This call is your opportunity to ask any questions you need to ensure they're a good fit for your company. Once you've made your decision, we offer the candidate the job, and once they accept, they'll start working for you.

The Key to Successful Recruitment: Finding the Right Fit for Your Real Estate Business with ShoreAgents.
In conclusion, recruiting a one-agent staff member requires a unique approach that focuses on finding the right fit for your real estate business. Creating a detailed job role, documenting all necessary tasks, and using our unique company interview process are the keys to successful recruitment. With the help of ShoreAgents, you can easily find the right candidate for your one-agent staff member role and ensure they'll fit seamlessly into your business.

Chapter 2: Training and Onboarding: Things to Consider After Accepting Your New One Agent Staff Member
Preparing for Your One Agent Staff Member's Start Date: Software and Communication Tools
Congratulations on selecting your new one-agent staff member! Now that you have accepted the candidate and signed the job offer, it's essential to prepare for their start date to ensure a smooth onboarding experience.

One of the most critical things to consider is the software and communication tools the staff member will be using within your business. It's important to make sure you have all the necessary logins and access prepared, and we recommend creating a company email for the staff member to use for all communications and logins.

Establishing Efficient Task Management Processes for Your One Agent Staff Member

Another consideration is how tasks will move from your internal team to your external one agent staff member. Do you have any productivity software in place to manage and delegate tasks? It's crucial to establish clear processes for task management to ensure efficiency and accountability.

Creating a Training Plan for Your New One Agent Staff Member: A Key Element for Successful Onboarding
Additionally, it's important to have a training plan in place for your new staff member. This includes providing them with all necessary training materials, scheduling training sessions, and assigning a point of contact for them to ask questions and receive support during their onboarding process.

Establishing Clear Communication Channels and Expectations with Your New One Agent Staff Member

Finally, make sure to establish clear communication channels and expectations with your new staff member. Will you be having regular check-ins or team meetings? How often will you be communicating with them? These are all crucial elements to consider when onboarding a new one agent staff member to ensure their success in your business.

Chapter 3: Communication and Productivity Tools for Success

When it comes to managing a one-agent staff member, communication and productivity tools are crucial for success. In this chapter, we will dive deeper into the importance of these tools and how they can benefit your business.

Enhancing Productivity with Task Management Software for Virtual Teams

Productivity software such as Clickup, Asana, Basecamp, Airtable, and Trello are specifically designed to help manage and delegate tasks efficiently. These tools make it easy to track progress, assign tasks, and communicate with your staff member. With numerous options available, it's important to research and find a tool that works best for your business needs.

The good thing about productivity software is that they are designed for remote work and make life very easy. They allow you to easily pass tasks between your team and your virtual staff member. Whether you use Google, Outlook, or Teams, the system should be easy to use and accessible to all team members involved in the project.

Effective Communication Platforms for Managing a Virtual Staff Member
Clear communication channels are critical when managing a virtual staff member. Establishing an efficient communication platform that allows you to communicate effectively is important. Popular options include WhatsApp, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet. It's important to select a platform that works best for your business and meets your specific communication needs.

The communication platform you choose will also play a crucial role in conducting training and communicating with your staff member. If your staff member will be on the telephone, you need to have a VoIP system set up. This will enable them to communicate effectively with other members of your team and customers.

Benefits of Productivity and Communication Tools in Virtual Staff Management

Chapter 5: How We Together Manage Your One Agent Team Member
Once you've selected your one agent team member and established a clear communication channel with them, the next step is to manage them effectively. Managing a remote worker can be challenging, especially when they are located on the other side of the world. This is where ShoreAgents comes in with a three-tiered approach to managing your remote team member's performance and relationship with your organization.

Maximizing Performance with Performance Reviews for Your Remote Staff
ShoreAgents believes that no one is better suited to comment on your staff member's performance than you. As their direct manager, you'll be the one administering the work and conducting training daily. We rely on you to take responsibility for these tasks. To provide critical feedback, we'll reach out to you in interviews held during the first, third, and fifth months following your hire(s) and annually thereafter.

During these reviews, we'll obtain feedback related to your staff member's quality of work, desire to improve, job knowledge, communication, teamwork, time management, reliability, and overall attendance. We'll assess the feedback received for each team member individually and take necessary actions, including meeting with you and the team member if needed, to help you avoid any negative consequences for your business. If appropriate, we can implement training plans to help your staff improve and explore new areas.

Catch-Ups for Effective Remote Staff Management
Catch-ups with your remote workers are undertaken monthly by our success team to obtain feedback about how they're handling working with you and your internal staff. We'll shoulder this responsibility, as there may be information they're more comfortable sharing privately with us. We'll use this information to help your staff improve in areas they may be struggling with or are eager to learn more about. Once we receive this worker feedback, we'll conduct a one-on-one session with each team member to discuss the results in detail.

The Importance of Check-Ins in Managing Remote Staff Members
During the early days of your staff member's engagement, we'll check-in weekly to ensure they're fitting into their roles and the office environment. A successful start is essential for every new team member, and check-ins help us identify critical areas where additional workers can offer the most assistance and value. With every check-in, our success team will assess the ongoing work and worker performance levels and provide feedback to you and your team. These check-ins will be conducted regularly every week until you feel they're no longer needed and/or your team member is settled in and performing to the best of their ability.

Managing Remote Workers Made Easy with ShoreAgents' Three-Tiered Approach
Managing a remote worker can be a daunting task, but with the help of ShoreAgents, we can ensure that your staff member is performing to their best ability.

BUILD A TEAM
Chapter 1: Introduction
So you want to build a team with ShoreAgents? Congratulations on taking this significant step towards optimizing your business operations! We're excited to potentially have you on board. As a leading outsourcing provider, we understand the unique requirements and challenges of assembling and managing a remote team, and we're here to help you every step of the way.

Building a team versus hiring one agent can indeed be a different experience, but with the right guidance and support, it can be a rewarding and transformative decision for your business. A well-built team can help you scale your operations, increase efficiency, and maintain a high level of quality across various tasks and projects.

In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the entire process of building a remote team with ShoreAgents. We'll delve into crucial topics such as recruitment and how to find the best talent, onboarding and training to ensure a smooth start for your team members, account management and ongoing support to facilitate a productive work environment, and overcoming the challenges related to managing a remote team, including cultural differences and communication barriers.

By the end of this guide, you will have a solid understanding of the process, benefits, and best practices for building and managing a remote team with ShoreAgents. Whether you're new to outsourcing or looking to expand your existing remote workforce, this guide will provide you with valuable insights and practical advice to help you make the most of your investment in remote team building.

Chapter 2: Building a Team vs. Hiring One Agent
In this chapter, we will explore the differences between building a team and hiring a single agent, as well as the advantages and challenges of each approach. Understanding these differences will help you make informed decisions about how to structure your remote workforce and ensure the best possible outcomes for your business.

Building a team can indeed present its challenges, such as coordinating multiple people, ensuring effective communication, and managing potential conflicts. However, when set up correctly, a well-structured team can become a more efficient and powerful asset for your business.

The team approach is generally more suitable for mid-sized businesses that can benefit from having more specialized roles, allowing each team member to focus on their specific area of expertise. This results in a more efficient division of labor and higher overall performance, as opposed to having one person juggling multiple tasks with varying levels of proficiency.

When building a team, you will need to consider the following factors:
Define clear roles and responsibilities: Ensure that each team member has a well-defined role and a clear understanding of their responsibilities. This will help avoid confusion, duplication of efforts, and potential conflicts among team members.
Establish a strong team leader: Appoint a capable team leader who can act as the primary point of contact, manage the team's performance, and facilitate communication between the team and the rest of the organization.
Implement effective communication and collaboration tools: Choose the right tools and platforms that enable seamless communication and collaboration among team members, such as project management software, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools.
Create a supportive work environment: Foster a positive and inclusive work culture that encourages teamwork, open communication, and mutual respect. This will help create a strong sense of belonging and loyalty among team members, which is essential for a successful remote team.
On the other hand, hiring a single agent can be a more straightforward process, especially for small businesses or those just starting with outsourcing. While a single agent may be able to handle multiple tasks, their effectiveness may be limited by their skill set and capacity, potentially affecting the quality and efficiency of their work.

In conclusion, the decision to build a team or hire a single agent depends on the size and needs of your business, as well as your long-term goals and vision. By carefully considering these factors and following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can build a remote workforce that drives your business forward and contributes to its success.

Selecting the right team leader is essential for fostering a cohesive, high-performing remote team. In this chapter, we'll discuss the importance of identifying and developing a team leader, as well as the qualities to look for and how to empower them to effectively manage your team.
Importance of a Team Leader: A team leader serves as the bridge between you and your remote team. They are responsible for coordinating team activities, overseeing daily operations, and ensuring that everyone is working towards a common goal. A strong team leader can alleviate much of the stress associated with managing multiple team members, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your business.
Qualities to Look For: When identifying a potential team leader, consider their communication skills, problem-solving abilities, adaptability, and capacity to motivate and inspire their team members. The ideal candidate should possess a strong work ethic, be proactive, and have a solid understanding of your business and its objectives.
Promoting from Within: It's crucial to promote a team leader from within your existing team, rather than bringing in someone from the outside. This approach ensures that the chosen individual has a deep understanding of the team's dynamics, work processes, and company culture. Promoting from within also demonstrates your commitment to recognizing and rewarding hard work and dedication, leading to increased morale and loyalty among your team members.
Providing Support and Training: Once you've identified a team leader, it's essential to provide them with the necessary support and training to succeed in their new role. This may include leadership training, ongoing mentorship, and access to resources that will help them develop their skills and manage the team effectively.
Empowering Your Team Leader: Empower your team leader by granting them the autonomy to make decisions and manage the team's daily operations. Trusting them to handle these responsibilities will not only boost their confidence but also improve their ability to lead the team effectively.
Regular Check-ins and Feedback: Maintain an open line of communication with your team leader, conducting regular check-ins to discuss their progress and address any concerns they may have. Provide constructive feedback and guidance to help them grow in their role and continue to enhance their leadership abilities.
In summary, identifying and developing a team leader is a critical aspect of building a successful remote team. By selecting a capable and committed individual, providing them with the necessary support and training, and empowering them to lead, you can create a strong foundation for your team's growth and long-term success.

Communication Styles: Different cultures may have unique ways of expressing themselves, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings.

Encourage your team members to ask questions and share their thoughts, and be mindful of potential language barriers or nuances in communication.
Work Ethic and Time Management: Different cultures may have varying expectations regarding work hours, punctuality, and work-life balance. Establishing clear expectations from the outset can help mitigate any potential issues. Be flexible when possible and strive to create a work environment that respects and accommodates the diverse needs of your team members.
Decision-Making and Problem-Solving: Cultural differences can also influence decision-making and problem-solving approaches. Ensure that your team members understand the expectations surrounding these processes and provide guidance as needed. Encourage collaboration and the sharing of ideas, fostering an environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing their perspective.
Building Trust and Rapport: Establishing trust and rapport among team members with diverse cultural backgrounds can take time and effort. Organize team-building activities and promote open communication to help bridge cultural gaps and foster a strong sense of camaraderie.

Chapter 9: Ensuring Redundancy and Scalability
In this chapter, we will discuss the importance of redundancy and scalability when building a team with ShoreAgents, as well as strategies to achieve them. Having a well-structured team ensures that your business remains operational and can grow seamlessly, even if one team member is unavailable or if your workload increases.
Cross-training and Skill Development: To ensure redundancy, it's crucial to cross-train team members in multiple tasks and responsibilities. This enables them to cover for each other during absences or emergencies. Encourage skill development and knowledge sharing among team members to create a versatile workforce capable of stepping in whenever needed.
Documentation and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Developing comprehensive documentation and SOPs for your team's tasks and processes is vital. This ensures that any team member can quickly understand and execute tasks, even if they are not their primary responsibility. Regularly update these documents to keep them relevant and useful.
Backup Plans and Contingency Strategies: Establish backup plans and contingency strategies for critical tasks and roles. For example, designate backup team leaders or key personnel who can step in during emergencies or absences. This will help maintain continuity and reduce the impact of unforeseen events on your business operations.
Scalable Team Structure: Design your team structure to be scalable, allowing you to add or reassign team members as your business grows or your needs change. This might involve creating specialized sub-teams or implementing a flexible organizational hierarchy that can be easily adjusted.
Regular Performance Reviews and Team Assessments: Conduct regular performance reviews and team assessments to identify areas for improvement and potential bottlenecks. By addressing these issues proactively, you can ensure that your team remains agile and can adapt to changing circumstances.
Effective Communication and Collaboration: Foster a culture of open communication and collaboration within your team. This will encourage team members to support each other and share their knowledge and expertise, contributing to redundancy and scalability.
Leveraging Technology: Utilize productivity and communication tools to streamline workflows and enhance collaboration. These tools can help your team stay organized and connected, allowing for seamless coordination and the ability to scale up or down as needed.

CREATE A WORKFORCE
Chapter 1: Understanding Workforce with ShoreAgents
At ShoreAgents, we define a workforce as a group of staff members numbering six or more. Our specific service guide is designed to meet the unique requirements that come with building a larger workforce, as opposed to forming a smaller team or hiring a single agent. This guide will help you understand how to effectively structure and manage your workforce with us.

The first step towards building a workforce with ShoreAgents is a clear understanding of your internal team structure. This is crucial because when establishing a workforce in the Philippines, different teams or groups of team members are required to specialize in various sectors. Let's consider an example.

Suppose you run a property development business, and you plan to outsource certain operations, like your finance department, contract administration, property marketing, and general back-office tasks. In that case, you would require distinct teams for each area. This could mean needing three contract administrators, five staff members for your finance department, five for basic admin support, six for property marketing, and perhaps a few drafters.

It's crucial that you identify team leaders within your organization who will be responsible for managing these divisions in the Philippines. They will serve as your primary points of contact and will be responsible for maintaining smooth operations.

Remember, building a workforce isn't just about hiring a group of people to complete tasks. It's about creating a well-structured, efficient, and collaborative system that ensures your business runs smoothly. By taking the time to understand what a workforce really means and how it applies to your business, you're already on your way to building a successful team with ShoreAgents.

In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into how you can evaluate your current team structure and how to adapt it for your workforce in the Philippines. Continue reading to learn more!

Chapter 2: Evaluating Your Team Structure
Once you have a solid understanding of what building a workforce with ShoreAgents entails, the next step is to evaluate your internal team structure. This is a crucial process that will shape your offshore team and determine its efficiency and effectiveness.

The goal is to create a structure that complements your existing operations and maximizes the capabilities of your offshore team. This involves understanding the roles you need to fill, the number of individuals required for each role, and who will manage each team.

If you operate a property development business and plan to outsource various functions, for example, you need to determine how many individuals you require in each department. This could be three contract administrators, five in finance, five in basic administration, six in property marketing, and perhaps a few drafters. This assessment helps you understand the scale of your offshore team.

Next, identify team leaders within your organization who will oversee these divisions in the Philippines. These leaders should be capable of managing the team, understanding their needs, and ensuring their performance aligns with your company's goals. These team leaders will act as the bridge between your local and offshore teams, ensuring a seamless flow of communication and effective coordination.

It's crucial to remember that your offshore team's structure should mirror your organization's culture and values. Ensure that the roles, responsibilities, and hierarchy align with your business ethos and are designed to promote collaboration and productivity.

Evaluating your internal team structure is not a one-time process but should be an ongoing activity. As your business grows and evolves, your team structure should also adapt to accommodate new roles, increased workload, and operational changes.

In the next chapter, we will delve deeper into how to structure your offshore team in the Philippines, focusing on how to choose leaders and foster growth. 

Chapter 3: Structuring Your Offshore Team
After evaluating your team structure, the next step is to form the structure of your offshore team in the Philippines. Here, you need to designate leaders who will manage your on-site team, ensuring smooth operation and communication between your local and offshore teams.

The process of forming your offshore team is not an overnight task but a gradual process. It's recommended to build your team from the ground up, focusing initially on hiring the right individuals who can evolve into team leaders. This approach has two benefits. 

Firstly, these individuals get to understand the nuances of your business from the start, and secondly, they grow along with the team, giving them an in-depth understanding of your offshore operations.

Let's look at the process more closely. Start by hiring individuals for the key roles in your offshore team, ensuring they possess the necessary skills and aptitude for the job. Once these individuals are in place, identify the ones who show leadership potential. These could be individuals who excel in their tasks, show a knack for problem-solving, and have the ability to inspire their colleagues. 

Promote these individuals to leadership roles, giving them the responsibility to manage their respective teams.

Another critical aspect of structuring your offshore team is establishing a strong line of communication between the team leaders and your local team. Regular meetings, updates, and performance reports should be standard practices, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

Lastly, keep in mind that your offshore team structure should not be rigid. As your business grows and evolves, you may need to tweak your team structure, add new roles, or even create new teams. This adaptability is key to maintaining an efficient and productive offshore team.

In the next chapter, we will guide you through the hiring process with ShoreAgents, providing insights into how we find and filter the right talent for your team. 

Chapter 4: Hiring Process with ShoreAgents
Now that you have a clear understanding of your team structure and the roles you need to fill, the next step is hiring the right people. At ShoreAgents, we strive to make the hiring process as efficient and effective as possible. Let's look at how we do it.

Firstly, we submit work orders for each job role you provide. These orders outline the skills, experience, and qualifications required for each position. With these specifications in mind, we then search the market for suitable candidates. With our extensive database of 25,000 candidates specializing in real estate roles, we have a rich pool of talent to draw from.

Next, we conduct a thorough screening process. This begins with arranging interviews with candidates who pass our initial suitability assessment and required tests. Our success team conducts a one-on-one company interview with each candidate over Zoom, recording the call for your review. This not only saves you time but also allows you to make informed decisions.

Once the interviews are complete, we provide you with the candidates' resumes, test results, and interview recordings. You can review this information at your convenience and select candidates for a final interview. We then schedule Zoom calls at a time that suits your team members, allowing them to conduct the final interviews. This is your chance to ask role-specific questions and assess if the candidates are a good fit for your company.

Upon your satisfaction with the candidates, you notify us of your hiring decisions. We take it from there, sending out job offers and arranging start dates for each new team member.

At ShoreAgents, we strive to streamline the hiring process, ensuring you get the right talent for your team without the usual hassles and time-consuming processes of traditional recruitment.

In the next chapter, we will discuss onboarding and training, providing you with insights on how to ensure a smooth start for your new team members. 

Chapter 5: Onboarding and Training with ShoreAgents
Once you have selected your new team members, the next step is onboarding and training. This phase is critical as it sets the stage for how your new employees will integrate into your organization and their specific roles. With ShoreAgents, we aim to make this process as seamless as possible.

The first part of the onboarding process involves setting start dates for your new hires. It's a good practice to have employees in similar roles start on the same day. This facilitates group training and allows team members to form bonds from the outset, which can enhance team cohesion.

Before your workforce starts, consider the tools and software they will need to effectively carry out their tasks. Ensure they have the necessary access to these resources from day one. This could involve anything from specific project management software to access to certain company databases or platforms.

Alongside this, a comprehensive training plan is vital to guide their role for the first month, three months, and beyond. This should cover all tasks they will be responsible for and any company-specific processes or protocols they need to follow. Remember, it's your responsibility to train staff members on their assigned tasks within your business.

Regarding onboarding, ShoreAgents schedules a separate call with you or the relevant person in your business to ensure readiness. We onboard the staff members, ensuring they have everything they need and are prepared for their first day. Our team will introduce you to your dedicated account manager, who will coordinate with your team for day-one planning and other requirements.

The goal of onboarding and training is not only to familiarize your new hires with their roles but also to make them feel part of your organization. A well-structured onboarding process can boost employee engagement, productivity, and retention, so it's worth investing the time and resources to get it right.

In the next chapter, we will delve into managing your offshore team, providing you with insights into effective communication, performance monitoring, and engagement strategies. 

Chapter 6: Managing Your Offshore Team
Successfully managing an offshore team can seem daunting. However, with clear communication, effective performance monitoring, and strong engagement strategies, you can ensure that your offshore team is as productive and cohesive as your local team.

Project management software is crucial when it comes to managing a large team. Tools like ClickUp, Airtable, Monday, and SANA offer a range of features that allow you to track tasks, deadlines, and the overall performance of your staff. By implementing such software, you can monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and manage workload distribution effectively.

Communication is another vital aspect of team management. Clear, consistent, and open communication ensures that your offshore team fully understands their responsibilities, is aware of any changes or updates, and feels comfortable voicing any concerns or suggestions. 

Reliable platforms such as Slack or WhatsApp can facilitate smooth and efficient communication within your workforce. Remember, regular team meetings and one-on-one sessions with team members can also enhance communication and build stronger relationships.

ShoreAgents also provides support for staff management. We adopt a three-tiered approach that includes regular check-ins, monthly catch-up sessions, and performance reviews. Regular check-ins, especially in the initial months, allow us to provide feedback and support to new team members. Monthly catch-up sessions enable us to address any issues and maintain open lines of communication. 

Performance reviews, conducted in the first, third, and fifth months, determine whether a staff member will become a regular employee, as per the labor laws in the Philippines.
In addition to performance management, employee engagement is paramount. 

ShoreAgents prioritizes creating a productive and happy workplace environment, organizing various activities and events to celebrate holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, and outstanding performance. We encourage you to also implement your own initiatives to foster a sense of belonging and alignment with your company culture.

In the next chapter, we will talk about the physical workspace, detailing how ShoreAgents provides a conducive environment for your offshore team. 

Chapter 7: Physical Workspace for Your Offshore Team
In an offshore work environment, the physical workspace your team operates in can play a crucial role in their productivity, engagement, and overall job satisfaction. ShoreAgents understands the importance of creating a suitable work environment for your offshore team, and we have various strategies in place to support this.

Firstly, we offer private workspaces for your team. These workspaces are designed to provide a conducive environment for your employees, fostering productivity and efficiency. Importantly, these workspaces can be customized to reflect your branding, establishing a sense of your own office for your offshore team. This not only enhances a feeling of professionalism and commitment but also reinforces your team's connection to your business.

As your workforce expands, we provide discounts to reflect the economies of scale achieved. This means you can continue to provide a high-quality work environment for your growing team, without the costs spiraling out of control.


Apart from the physical environment, we also provide a ticketing system for both clients and staff members. This system allows you to request tasks or catch up with the success team. Similarly, your staff members can use it to report any issues or request equipment upgrades. By doing so, we ensure that your team has the tools they need to perform their roles effectively and that any issues are promptly addressed.

To navigate the challenges that may arise in managing an offshore team, especially those related to cultural differences, ShoreAgents provides dedicated support. Think of our success team as your dedicated concierge service, there to guide you through the process and ensure a smooth experience.
In the final chapter, we will discuss how to tackle challenges you may face while building your offshore team and how ShoreAgents assists in overcoming these hurdles. 

Chapter 8: Overcoming Challenges in Building Your Offshore Team

Building and managing a large offshore team can come with its unique set of challenges. Cultural differences, language barriers, and time zone disparities can impact various aspects of your team's functioning. However, with a strategic approach and the right support, these challenges can be navigated effectively.

At ShoreAgents, we have successfully helped many companies build their workforces in the Philippines, guiding them through potential obstacles and providing solutions. Here are some common challenges and how we address them:

Cultural Differences: Differences in work culture and social norms can impact communication, negotiation, and overall team dynamics. Our success team has an in-depth understanding of both Western and Filipino cultures and is well-equipped to bridge this gap. We assist you in navigating sensitive topics such as discussing salaries and performance, ensuring that all communication respects and takes into account cultural nuances.
Language Barriers: Although English is widely spoken in the Philippines, there may be times when language barriers pose a challenge. To mitigate this, we ensure all our candidates have a strong proficiency in English and are comfortable in a global work environment.
Time Zone Disparities: Different time zones can impact collaboration and communication within the team. However, the flexibility and willingness of the Filipino workforce to adapt to different work schedules can significantly help in overcoming this challenge.
Performance Management: Managing performance from afar can be a challenge. Our three-tiered approach to staff management, which includes regular check-ins, monthly catch-up sessions, and performance reviews, ensures that performance standards are met and any issues are promptly addressed.
Engagement and Integration: Building a sense of belonging and connection with your company can be more challenging with an offshore team. To tackle this, ShoreAgents organizes various activities and events for your team. We encourage you to implement your own initiatives to further foster integration and alignment with your company culture.

Building an offshore team is a journey, one that can lead to immense growth and success for your company. While there may be hurdles along the way, with ShoreAgents by your side, you'll be well-equipped to overcome them.

STAFF MANAGEMENT
A Three-Tiered Approach
When you manage employees locally, you’re 100 percent in control. However, when your staff is located on the other side of the world, it can present minor challenges. But don’t worry; we have you covered.

ShoreAgents has a three-tiered approach — via Performance Reviews, Catch-Ups and Check-Ins — to managing the performance and relationship you have with your remote team members. Acquiring feedback from all parties and points of view is vital to your team’s success. We obtain feedback from you, your organization, your remote staff members and our own staff investigations.

Performance Reviews
No one is as fit to comment on the performance of your staff as you. After all, you’ll be the one administering the work and conducting worker training daily; we rely on you to take responsibility for these tasks. We’ll reach out to you in interviews held during the first, third and fifth months following your hire(s) (and annually thereafter) to provide critical feedback.

Feedback will specifically be related to a team member’s:
Quality of work
Desire to improve
Job knowledge
Communication
Teamwork
Time management
Reliability
Overall attendance

When we receive this feedback, we’ll assess the comments for each worker individually and take actions as necessary (including meeting with you and the individual team member) to help you avoid any future pain or negative consequences for your business. If it’s appropriate, we can implement training plans to help your staff improve in and explore new areas.

Catch-Ups
Catch-Ups with your remote workers are undertaken monthly by our success team. We do this to get feedback from them about how they’re handling working with you and your internal staff. We believe in shouldering this responsibility, as there may be information they’re more comfortable sharing privately with us. We use this information to help them improve in areas they may be struggling with or are eager to learn more about. They may even have suggestions that would help you and your business.

Once we receive this worker feedback, we’ll conduct a one-on-one session with each team member to discuss the results in detail. We’ll put together a monthly action plan and then extend an opportunity for you to have a discussion with us about our findings. This will tell you how the satisfaction level of your team members (rated as “happy,” “satisfied” or “unhappy”) relates to their tasks and work environment.

Check-Ins
During the early days of your new staff engagements, we’ll check in weekly to ensure your hires are fitting into their roles and the office environment. A successful start is essential for every new team member, and Check-Ins help us to identify critical areas of your business where we believe additional workers can offer the most assistance and value. With every Check-In, our success team will assess the ongoing work and worker performance levels and provide feedback to you and your team.

These Check-Ins will be conducted regularly every week until you feel they’re no longer needed and/or your team member is settled in and performing to the best of their ability. If, at any point during your worker’s engagement, you or your organization feels the need for such Check-Ins to resume, simply let us know, and we’ll re-institute them until you advise us to do otherwise.

This three-tiered approach to staff management is extremely important for your remote working success.

Staff Engagement
Keeping your staff happy in their work setting is one of our top priorities, and we excel at it. All our engagements are geared toward encouraging performance for clients and making team members’ work environments great places to be, so they can attract your next superstar team members.
Day 1
From the day your new staff members start, we’ll have already engaged them on your behalf to ensure their happiness and excitement for their new jobs remain robust. And it doesn’t stop there.

Employee of the Month
We have a unique scoring system covering multiple areas that selects an Employee of the Month every month. A team member can only achieve this prestigious distinction by blowing your expectations for them out of the water. We have micro prizes for each job area to encourage all team members to excel and other awards to encourage the entire team.

Work Anniversary
Celebrating life events is an established tradition in the Philippines, and work anniversaries are among the most important of these. Commemorating these events with showers of gifts and praise for your workers ensures a long tenure for your team as they celebrate each passing year; we encourage you to join in and help make these festivities special.

Monthly Activities
Monthly fun and games make commuting to our office worthwhile for your workers. These games are carefully selected to fit culturally and amuse them; we understand your team members and what pleases them.

Birthdays
We never miss a birthday, as birthdays are important and memorable occasions in the Philippines. Birthdays are occasions when workers can talk informally with their colleagues and get to know them better. The more friends your team members make at work, the more likely they’ll be to stay at their job.

Clubs
ShoreAgents maintains several different activity clubs for team members to enjoy doing things they love after work. Some of these include the Shore Book Club, the Shore Photography Club, the Shore Music Club and the Shore Fitness Club.

Endless Free Coffee and Subsidized Food

Free coffee and subsidized food are provided to team members so they’ll have no shortage of energy and motivation.

Free Shuttles
All of the above elements will ensure that your team members are 100 percent satisfied; however, we don’t stop there — we’ll also consult with you on additional means you can employ to maintain a successful working relationship with your workers.

Introducing the Success Team
Our success team is always on call to help you through the outsourcing journey, and we’ll guide you from the moment you select your first new workers to the period when they’re fully engaged with your organization. You’ll always have direct access to our team of experts for literally anything you need support with.

We use a ticketing system for support and purchasing for you and your staff. If you need any help with your workers, simply submit a ticket, and our team will respond immediately. Likewise, if your workers have any concerns, they also can submit a ticket, and we’ll respond to it instantly. These systems are part of our standard operating services, and they come at no additional charge.

Managing Director
Working Since 2013 to Make Outsourcing Better

We will make it work

I am not sure how I ended up just up and leaving Australia to move over the Philippines to build and run a BPO for Real Estate. I am pretty sure it was a big accident, but somehow it was meant to be. I have loved Real Estate since the day I got my first listing at just 18; it was like a drug. Hence I fell into owning my own Real Estate business and then started the journey of outsourcing to take it to the next level.

Implementing an Offshore team was hard work and I made many mistakes; however, I eventually got it all to work. I was always passionate about helping other Real Estate Business owners getting outsourcing set up, so maybe it was not an accident, and it was fate not that I believe much in that.

Today I could not be happier as I get to do what I love the most, talk Real Estate, help other business owners thrive and grow a big business of my own while I am at it. If you would ever like to chat, feel free to reach out.

2005
The Start of my Real Estate Journey
I got into Real Estate back when I was 18 at the very end of 2005. I used to be a personal trainer at the time, and I trained the principal of Metrocity Realty, Greg Jackson. He was impressed with my hunger and grit, as that was how I got him into the Gym in the first place. He stuck me in Sales from day one, and this is where I learned the Hussle and got my first listing, and made my first sale! Greg was a great mentor and taught me to save and invest in property. I saved up in the time I was at Metro to buy my first home and additionally an investment property.

2008
Back in the game with loads of life experience
I took six months off work and went on a traveling adventure to get some life experience under my belt. I returned to Aus. and wanted to work closer to where I lived and grew up. So I started working at Ray White in Mt Gravatt. I listed a property on my first day and sold the property the following weekend. I got the hang of it and started to brand myself! I made rookie of the year and grossed 260k in commission. I began to think of this Real Estate Game as a real career and wanted to give it now 100% of my attention.

2010
Dipping the toe into running my own show
I decided to make a move to Re/max and become a contractor so I could keep a bit more commission in my pocket. There was a lot more flexibility at Re/max, and I made listing and selling my obsession. My personal brand developed, and my sales went through the roof, achieving the number one agent status in the office for most of the calendar months. My best months had me sitting in the top 5 in QLD, Number 6 in Aus, and achieving an award that I had to go pick up in Las Vegas. I hired a PA and started to think that running my own show was for me!
 
2012
The real deal, my own Real Estate Business!
I took the plunge and thought to stuff it, I am just going to do it! I loved starting my own brand and going through all the emotions that go with it. The ups, downs, and challenges were not on my plate when I was just worried about listing and selling. Sales kept pumping, and I developed the company as a real competitor in the market. I now turned my focus on building a team and creating the process I needed to go next level. Next on the agenda was establishing a rent role, and this is where I first started to utilize Offshore staff to grow, and that is certainly what we did.

2015
Big Business! Beyond Compare™
My business was growing. However, we were known to sell cheap properties and lost out to some of the more well-known brands. I decided to strip it back and rebrand while purchasing another office to add to our two. We went big with the brand, and it got us in more doors, and we saturated the market! The rent roll grew, our team grew, and I decided to eventually sell out and let someone take over while I eye off my next business challenges to overcome!

Outsourcing Experience
There are two sides of the coin when it comes to outsourcing. The customer side and the BPO side and I have huge experience in both.

CUSTOMER SIDE - FRUSTRATION
As a customer, I have used many different service providers to find staff and house them for our company. I found it very frustrating dealing with a provider that did not understand the Real Estate Game and what team members I required. I ended up having to create my own whole system anyways. Instead of getting frustrated, I got fascinated and started to develop my own unique strategies to make outsourcing work.

SERVICE PROVIDER - SOLUTION
Being on the customer side helped me develop the ultimate solution on the service provider side. All the issues I faced before as a customer, we have ironed out to make a far superior solution. We build a talent pool of pre educated staff that understand the real estate game and what is required. The right start makes for a smooth journey and an increased speed of implementation.

Frequently Asked Questions
OUTSOURCING
What is outsourcing?
Outsourcing is delegating certain tasks to specific functions that may not be the company’s core focus. This involves hiring external professionals from a specialized agency to handle various tasks and responsibilities. ShoreAgents is a real estate outsourcing agency that acts as an intermediary connecting real estate businesses with qualified candidates.

Why should you outsource?
Outsourcing offers several advantages for your business. Primarily, you can focus on your business’s core competencies while reducing operational costs. Not to mention your overall productivity and operations will significantly increase.

Particularly if you outsource through a real estate staffing solution agency like ShoreAgents, you can skip the tedious recruitment process which can lead to a more efficient and thorough search for the best candidates for your firm.

Why should you outsource in the Philippines?
The Philippines provides an excellent combination of a highly skilled workforce and lower labor costs compared to Western countries. The country’s strong presence in the BPO industry also makes it an attractive deal for several businesses looking to enhance their operations. Filipino staff members are also familiar with the BPO services and have a diverse skill set to fulfill various duties. This includes customer service, data entry, back-office duties, and tech support among others.

Outsourcing in the Philippines is an ideal option for companies that are looking to achieve cost savings and access to a global talent pool. Since the majority of professionals in the country are university graduates, you can expect to onboard highly qualified virtual staff members who are proficient in English and are dedicated to accomplishing various tasks before the deadline.

Should I Hire a Virtual Assistant through a Freelance Platform or through a BPO Agency?
While hiring a virtual assistant through a freelance platform is an option, it may not be the best choice for your business. Since the global market has consistently increased over the past few years due to the popularity of remote work, hiring a freelancer is a lot more costly than you may expect.

Aside from this, the rising number of freelancers makes it more difficult for recruitment firms to find top talent. Freelancers are generally known to work on multiple projects and serve various clients at once, which may result in a slower turnaround time affecting overall productivity.

Not to mention that if you hire a freelancer, you will need to review all the applications sent and spend more time on recruitment tasks. This includes pre-screen all the candidates, conducting interviews, onboarding, and staff retainment.

Whereas if you hire through a BPO agency like ShoreAgents, you can guarantee that your virtual staff members are dedicated to your business alone. You can also skip the time-consuming process of hiring as this may not be your expertise – our success team will handle the rest and present the qualified candidates for your business.

At the same time, your virtual staff members are also more likely to stay with a real estate outsourcing company for stability and career growth. In comparison to a freelancer’s global market, hiring through a BPO agency like ShoreAgents ensures that your virtual team members are provided with the necessary work facilities and equipment, fully engaged in the team, and rewarded for their hard work.

How does the outsourcing process begin?
Initially, the process of outsourcing begins once you identify the tasks and functions that need to be delegated. Whether these are non-core duties or roles that require specific expertise, an outsourcing agency can assist in ensuring a successful process for finding the right talent for your company.

At ShoreAgents, our outsourcing process begins by letting us know about the type of talent that you look forward to hiring.

How to Create a Job Description for Your Virtual Real Estate Assistant?
Writing a job description for a hiring remote real estate associate? It should be well-written and contain specific tasks that need to be done on a daily basis.

Some of the common departments include marketing, finance, and sales. Regardless of the designated department in the industry, it’s best to elaborate on the specifics.

Here are some steps that you can follow to write an effective job description:
Step 1. Define the duties & responsibilities
Indicating the primary tasks of a VA is essential. The responsibilities can always vary depending on your preference. For instance, if you're looking to hire for an entry-level role, then the duties should be aligned.
Step 2. Specify the requirements, expertise, and skills
Include in the job description if you prefer a candidate with or without a degree and experience. Specify the necessary capabilities and skills needed for the assistant job. For example, a degree in business or real estate or administrative work. You can also state skillfulness in computer programs such as Microsoft Office.
Step 3. List all the equipment & software
What equipment and software do you need for your candidate to access? Some of the details can include a high-speed internet connection, a computer, and software for communication. This can include project management tools and bookkeeping software.

What are the Benefits of a Real Estate Virtual Assistant from the Philippines? 
As the director of ShoreAgents, I have explored other locations like South Africa, India, and Vietnam. I’ve outsourced to the Philippines since 2012 and found Filipino remote staff culturally aligned with the West.

The Philippines is an English-speaking country and is generally a Catholic country. This makes it more compatible with businesses in Western countries such as Australia, the USA, and Canada.

English language proficiency in the Philippines is excellent. This makes it easy to communicate with remote staff. The education level is also high, with many people having college and university degrees.

When you hire a real estate virtual staff from the Philippines, you are likely to work with highly educated people. Filipino virtual staff are creative and very proficient in English. They are also happy to do repetitive and back-office tasks with big smiles on their faces.

What Sectors of Real Estate Can a Virtual Assistant Support?
Well, the answer to that is all sectors. Remote VA jobs can be done online or over the phone, regardless if it’s in real estate or other industries.

We have successfully partnered with real estate agencies for sales and property management. This is because these areas entail more back-office work.

We have experience in supporting buyers, agents, mortgage companies, and real estate conveyancing. So, a virtual staff can support any sector of the real estate market. Well-prepared tasks, training, and preparation enable successful outsourcing to remote staff.

Virtual Assistant Services for Real Estate
1. Hire One Agent
Our real estate VA services include an entry-level service that comprises one agent. This service is good for smaller businesses that are looking to get some items off their plate. When it comes to using the one-agent service, we provide a whole bunch of support. Generally, the people taking out this service are new to it.

Due to having only one staff member, they are able to handle a wide range of tasks. Instead of focusing on a bigger business where they may be doing just one task.

The staff member and the client generally need more support to succeed. Our dedicated success team ensures that you’re getting the most out of your outsourcing journey and remote staff.
2. Build a Team
Our secondary service is designed for more support for when your business is expanding. You can hire a completely dedicated team with your agents. We provide scale discounts as you advance to higher service levels and hire more people.

As the business grows, you continue to diversify some of the tasks. You might have started with one agent in the sales admin space and then decided to outsource property management. You might be splitting up your sales admin and your property management to have one person dedicated to each. As the business grows, you can continue to develop your team and, hopefully, a team leader within that new team.
3. Create a Workforce
For bigger businesses, we offer a workforce service. A workforce service is for when you’re almost an expert at outsourcing. You’ve got all your systems in place and division heads to take care of your outsourced team.

So, you can cover many sectors within your business. Instead of being limited to back-office support for property management and minimal sales support.

Since online workers can help you with several tasks, you can now expand your focus on other pillars.

Our workforce model has proven to be very successful. We have teams of more than 25 individuals achieving great results.

What Makes the Best Real Estate Virtual Assistant?
The first step in choosing a virtual staff is recruitment. Finding someone with the right aptitude for the job and who fits within your business is essential.

The best real estate virtual staff should be able to perform simple tasks in your business. It's important to find a committed candidate who can learn and be a valuable long-term team member.
Use cloud-based tools and productivity management software to assign tasks easier. Some of the various tools on the market, such as ClickUp, Monday, Air Table, Asana, and Basecamp.

For instance, you can use forms in ClickUp to drive your remote staff. When a real estate agent lists a property for sale within your business, they fill out the new listing form. This creates a task on ClickUp for your virtual workers to complete.

You can also use education software like Udemy to train on tasks they may not be familiar with. For instance, utilizing it to optimize your real estate website.

When it comes to generating content, tools like Chat GTP can help with writing and proofreading. You can use research to create topics that the tool can easily generate unique content. Recording some audio and transcribing it can also help Chat GTP write like you.

Empower your online workers with the right tools and training to make them your best asset in the real estate business.

Who are the Top Real Estate Virtual Assistant Companies? 
Well, we are going to be biased and say that ShoreAgents is the top real estate virtual assistant company. As an owner of a real estate company, I found different virtual assistant companies lacking. I was hiring offshore staff in the Philippines and discovered factors related to this.
This includes a lack of in-office staff and poor management. When looking for the best real estate virtual assistant company, you need to look for certain things. Here's what you need to consider:
Office Location
First, are they located in an office, and where is their office? Is it situated in a safe part of the Philippines, such as Clark Pampanga, Cebu, or Manila? These things will determine whether they’re the right company for you.
To cite an example, Manila is prone to typhoons, floods, and volcanoes. It is also congested and makes it difficult for workers to get to an office. So this leads to a desire to work remotely with little success in the Philippines. This is also related to living standards, the internet, and the cost of living.
Recruitment
When it comes to recruitment, you need to consider how the company implements its process. This includes testing and filtering candidates, where they advertise, and how they do it. The goal is to have the best remote workers, not just any.
The company should also help you set up your operations in the Philippines and support you. This includes ensuring that your IT and software are both connected. You will also need to be available when the staff member encounters any issues and answer their questions about the process.
Company Engagement & Salary
The most crucial aspect is how the company engages with your staff. Do they have regular staff engagement? What’s the office environment like? Are your employees satisfied with the environment?
It would be disappointing to find the ideal employee, only to have them leave. Ensuring fair treatment and pleasant work environment is crucial.
Ensure that the company pays the right salary and is transparent with what you’re paying your staff member. Pricing varies according to several factors such as track record & education among others.
This depends on the salary level and the type of remote assistant that you are hiring. Outsourcing a remote assistant can save you about a third to a quarter of the cost compared to hiring locally.
If you go to our website under the roles section, we have cost comparison breakdowns. This involves a huge array of different roles throughout the industry. But it is not solely just about cost savings.
The right candidate can not only save you money but also help you generate money.

The Ultimate Guide to Outsourcing Processes and Procedures: PMVA companies

What is a Property Management Virtual Assistant?
A property management virtual assistant plays a crucial role by providing invaluable support for streamlining operations in the business. Since this role can accomplish the majority of tasks online, they work remotely and utilize various task management tools.

The best property management VA for a property management team should have expertise in organizing workflows and handling multiple tasks. While other firms opt for hiring locally, outsourcing a PMVA offers the most cost-efficient option. Particularly in countries like the Philippines which presents affordable labor expenses due to the low cost of living.

What Can a Property Management Virtual Assistant Do?
The tasks of a PMVA may vary depending on their skillset and experience. It can also depend on the company's assigned tasks in order to support property managers.

The process of property management is basically a flow. A property management virtual assistant handles various stages of the property management process. Starting with onboarding new landlords and advertising properties to attract prospective tenants.

They also manage tenant prospecting, lease agreements, property inspections, and repair coordination. At the same time, PMVAs handle lease renewals, vacates, and relisting tasks, ensuring smooth operations throughout the property management lifecycle.

While the PM's flow is fairly straightforward, it is time-consuming and involves ticking off a lot of boxes. Delegating tasks to a virtual assistant allows property managers to focus on growth and tenant satisfaction.

A property management virtual assistant can help with every step of the flow. Your dedicated team member will dramatically ease the time and administrative burden that is currently slowing down your processes. Let's take a look at some of the primary duties of a PMVA:

Outsourced Your New Property Management
The first step in the property management flow is onboarding new landlords and managing properties.

After securing a new client, your PMVA can handle the meticulous completion of documentation. While it's ideal for landlords to provide all paperwork at once, in reality, you may find yourself chasing details. This includes insurance, smoke alarm information, and bank accounts.

Your offshore staff can efficiently handle these tedious tasks. At the same time, it will free up your time for other important matters. A PMVA will also onboard the client into your systems, including your trust account software.

Outsourced Your Rental Property Advertising
After properly setting up your new client, you can immediately proceed to advertise the property. Of course, your experienced local property management staff will handle photos and property descriptions.

Your VA will handle the task of uploading property information to multiple ad portals such as Zilio, Trademe, Realestate.com.au, Domain, and more. Additionally, they will create and distribute social media posts across platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Whatsapp.

Outsource Your Rental Enquiries
Once you’ve got your successful advertising campaign in place, there will naturally be a surge in inquiries. Most of these are fairly basic and don’t require the time of your local staff. Leave it to your property management virtual assistant to handle emails, answer questions about the property, and advise about viewings.

Your PMVA can schedule inspection appointments using the online calendar and notify prospective tenants of their viewing time. They will also gather feedback from tenants, helping to distinguish interested and uninterested individuals. All your property manager needs to do then is follow up with the warmest leads and not deal with time wasters.

Outsourced Your Rental Application
By now, you’ll have a few good prospects who will have submitted applications. Your PMVA will process the app and make sure all the information is complete. If it’s not, they can immediately contact the applicants via SMS or email and fill in any missing details.

After that, it’s a simple process of checking rental, professional, and employment references. It is simple in theory but time-consuming in practice.

All of these tasks are vital but require a significant time investment. A PMVA can handle these details while property managers focus on prospecting for new landlords and properties. Once all the info and references are 100% completed, your PM passes the applications on to the landlord for approval.

Outsourced Your Rental Lease
At this point, it’s time to create a lease and start collecting money. Your PMVA will carefully follow all appropriate standards to create the lease and send it over to the tenant via email. They can then sign it via DocuSign or whatever system your office uses. Simultaneously, they'll inform the tenant about the deposit transfer process and ensure accurate setup in your accounting software.

They will provide the tenant with the necessary information for proper bond lodging, which is crucial for your property management business. Each step is vital but time-consuming. Once you know the requirements, your PMVA takes responsibility for completing the entire checklist.

Outsource Your Rental Initial Condition Report
Property inspections require the presence of your onsite team as offshore staff have limitations in performing this task. The property manager conducts the initial inspection report and takes photos using an app like PropertyMe. Subsequently, the PMVA completes the report, sends it to the tenant, and obtains their signature.

Outsource Your Rental Receipt
When we say that a PMVA is part of every step of the property management process, we mean it. This includes rent receipting where your property management VA can process your accounts and reconcile rent payments.

They’ll immediately flag which tenants are in arrears so that your local PM can follow up. Or they can even send the initial SMS or email themselves, giving the tenant a quick nudge. Your PMVA will follow your arrears process and bring in the big guns, i.e. your property manager, only when necessary.

Outsource Your Rental Maintenance
By setting up an online process, tenants can conveniently submit maintenance requests via Facebook or SMS. Once your PMVA receives the request, they can get in touch with your approved tradespeople and organize the repairs. 

Of course, as part of your maintenance process, you’ll include an approval step from the property manager. The PMVA then coordinates between the tradesperson and tenant, finds a suitable time, or arranges access.

This eliminates the time-consuming task of engaging in three-way conversations, increasing property managers' efficiency. With a dedicated virtual assistant, a property manager can potentially double the number of properties managed, as observed in our experience. A property manager can double their portfolio from 150 to 300 properties within weeks.

Outsource Your Rental Routine Inspections
As part of the initial leasing process, your PMVA will set up calendar alerts to set up routine inspections. Your property management team maintains online calendars with defined availability for inspections.

Using that information, your PMVA will coordinate with tenants to arrange the perfect time to carry out a routine inspection. They efficiently process the property manager's notes and photos into comprehensive reports, directly sending them to the landlord.

Outsource Your Rental Lease Renewals
When it’s nearing the end of a lease period, your PMVA will get an alert to start following up. Generally, you want to avoid empty properties, but this will depend on what the property manager, landlord, and tenant decide. Your PMVA will contact their property manager between 60 to 90 days before the lease is due to expire.

This allows the PM to understand the landlord's preferences. If the landlord approves the renewal, the PMVA informs the tenant and initiates the process. End-of-lease management is vital for maintaining landlord and tenant satisfaction. The PMVA ensures a seamless transition during this crucial period.
In the event of a tenant vacating, the PMVA makes sure that both parties have the necessary information for a smooth transition. At the same time, promptly resumes preparing advertising materials to find a new tenant.

Virtual Assistant Tools List: Which Tools are PMVAs familiar with?
Using tools empowers PMVAs to enhance efficiency, productivity, and effectiveness in property management tasks. These tools automate tasks, organize information, track progress, and facilitate seamless collaboration with property managers and tenants.

The following tools provide PMVAs with streamlined workflows, improved communication channels, and access to valuable data and resources:

Process and Procedure for Property Management Outsourcing
While you were reading this, hopefully, you noticed that the success of hiring a PMVA depends on procedures and processes. If your business lacks integration and communication among its various departments, managing offshore staff may present challenges.

It's important to note that hiring an offshore team is not a silver bullet. It requires time and effort to effectively manage your business. However, it can significantly reduce administrative tasks for your local staff, allowing them to focus on the work they enjoy.

What are the Advantages of Hiring a Property Management Virtual Assistant from the Philippines?
Several businesses prefer the Philippines as a source for outsourcing staff for a number of good reasons. The country’s established BPO industry provides a range of agencies to help businesses find their ideal offshore solution.

The Philippines excels in English proficiency and boasts a highly skilled workforce. With a mature offshoring model, it is the top choice for outsourcing needs. Here are some of the perks of offshoring a PMVA based in the Philippines:

Achieve Ultimate Cost-Savings 
In comparison to hiring a local PMVA, outsourcing in the Philippines is less costly. This is because of the country's low cost of living which reflects the labor costs as well.
A real estate agency in the USA will pay approximately one-third of the local rate for a Philippine-based assistant. In fact, employers can hire three virtual assistants for the price of one. Not to mention that there are other oncost fees and taxes to consider in other countries.
For instance, the average salary of a real estate virtual assistant in Australia costs $60,091 AUD. This excludes recruitment costs, payroll taxes, and other mandatory costs. Whereas in the Philippines, you can expect to pay $21,385 AUD inclusive of benefits, government charges, and ShoreAgents' fees.
This cost advantage makes outsourcing to the Philippines an attractive option for real estate agencies. Particularly those looking to maximize their workflow efficiency and save on staffing expenses.

Excellent Language Proficiency
The Philippines boasts high English proficiency rates comparable to those in Europe and English-speaking countries. Despite its Asian-Pacific location, the country demonstrates remarkable English proficiency.
All government communication, notices, and documentation are in English so expect to onboard staff members who are language proficient. At ShoreAgents, we filter the best candidates for your team. Our recruitment team ensures that your additional staff members are university graduates and can communicate effectively.

Onboard Highly Skilled Workforce
Not only can you achieve cost-savings and communicate well with your staff, but their skillset is also extensive. With a workforce of over 45 million people, the Philippines possesses many highly skilled individuals. Many young Filipinos utilize tuition-free technical schools and state colleges to enhance their education.
The government acknowledges the importance of a skilled workforce and has implemented policies and incentives to promote prolonged education. This has enabled Filipinos to acquire both general and specialized expertise.

Technological Competence
The majority of Filipino virtual assistants utilize various property management software and tools to accomplish tasks. The best part is that upon training, most of them are already familiar with using various tech applications.
By hiring through a BPO agency like ShoreAgents, we ensure the use of software productivity tools for efficient operations. We take care of preparing all the necessary tools required for workers to carry out their tasks effectively.

Cultural Fit
The Philippines has a strong cultural affinity with Western countries. Because of this, it has ensured smooth collaboration and understanding of business practices and customer service expectations. Working with Filipinos will not give as much culture shock compared to other countries.

How to Manage Your Outsourced Property Management Virtual Assistant?
Outsourcing in your property management department presents challenges, especially when it comes to day-to-day team management. Property management software often lacks the necessary detail for optimal business operations despite having basic task allocation and workflows. Here are five expert insights on how you can manage your outsourced PMVA:

Define Clear Expectations & Goals 
By providing detailed instructions to complete tasks and meet quality standards, you can expect your VA to excel. Effective communication of goals and setting deadlines will help your VA understand expectations. It is still necessary to train and provide guidance since no one else knows your business better than you.

Establish Effective Communication Channels
Set up regular communication channels with your virtual assistant to stay connected and provide guidance. Utilize tools like email, instant messaging, or project management platforms to facilitate clear and efficient communication. For instance, Slack is one of the recommended platforms for team communication. Particularly in the real estate business where professionals can organize their collaboration.

Provide Continuing Training & Resources
Invest time in training your virtual assistant on your property management processes, tools, and systems. Provide them with access to necessary resources, documents, and guidelines. This will enable them to perform their tasks effectively.
Fortunately, technology has advanced significantly in the past decade, offering impressive software solutions. We suggest exploring various tools to find the best fit for your needs. However, we highly recommend a project management tool such as Clickup.

Monitor and Provide Feedback for Improvement
Provide constructive feedback and guidance to help your virtual assistant improve their performance. Acknowledge their strengths and offer suggestions for areas where they can enhance their skills or efficiency. Regularly reviewing the progress of your virtual assistant's work to ensure they are on track. 

Staff Engagement
Build a positive working relationship with your virtual assistant by fostering open communication, trust, and mutual respect. Encourage collaboration and create a supportive environment that promotes their professional growth and satisfaction.
Conduct periodic performance evaluations to assess your virtual assistant's performance against set goals and expectations. Recognize their achievements and address any areas that may require improvement.

Remarkably, one of the key functions of a professional bookkeeper is to determine the firm's reports on profits and losses. Since they handle complex tasks like book closure and correcting financial errors, their routine duties demand meticulous attention to detail.

In this article, we'll feature the job description, average salary, and specialized insights of real estate bookkeepers. We also created a precise cost comparison in the Philippines vs other countries (USA, UK, CA, AU, and more).

Real estate bookkeeping comprises tracking and organizing financial transactions related to properties, investments, and operations. Precise record-keeping and financial management are both crucial to the bookkeeper role, particularly within the real estate industry.

Through this, bookkeepers will no longer worry about misplaced documents and have difficulty in reviewing them. Streamlining the bookkeeping processes also comes in handy with the help of outsourced staff members.

Duties & Responsibilities of a Real Estate Bookkeeper

Generally, a bookkeeper plays a significant role in fostering the financial well-being and success of a real estate business. By outsourcing a virtual bookkeeper, business owners can focus on core operations and other revenue-generating tasks.

What is the Cost Difference Between Bookkeepers Globally?

In comparison to the Philippines, the list of salaries for other countries does not cover additional costs. The amount of salary listed in the Philippines, however, includes government charges, employee benefits, and ShoreAgents' fees.

Evidently, the cost difference between hiring locally vs virtually in the Philippines is enormous. Not only can you save money, but you also get to access a talent pool for your real estate business.

With the price of one local staff member, you can recruit two or more in the Philippines. Aside from cost-efficiency, you can expect your staff to be efficient in English and handle various tasks.

A Day in the Life of a Virtual Bookkeeper from the Philippines 
What is the daily routine of a virtual bookkeeper, for instance, in a residential real estate business? You will have expenses and generate revenue on a daily basis. All of these things need to be accurate and reconciled daily. So that you, as the business owner, can have a clear report on profits and losses and make informed decisions.

Imagine that you have a bookkeeper located in the Philippines with their daily tasks. This will free you from engaging in unproductive functions that are not within your scope of responsibilities.
For example, with three property settlements sold, commissions need to be allocated accurately for distribution among agents.

The bookkeeper needs to report the income generated from the sale. At the same time, you also need to pay the expenses incurred during the sale. This includes marketing the property and other related costs.

Additionally, you will have expenses related to generating more listings on a daily basis. Expenses must be accurately categorized in the chart of accounts to determine the true profit per sale.

Your virtual bookkeeper in the Philippines, located here at ShoreAgents, will take care of all these repetitive tasks.

Suppose it is mid-month, and on the same day, you are managing a rental roll consisting of approximately 1,000 properties. Rent must be received and accounts reconciled on that day to distribute funds to landlords and collect management fees. The same process applies to expenses, and you will also have salaries to be paid out through payroll. Again, your virtual bookkeeper can handle all of this.

So, on a daily basis, your bookkeeper will be a low-cost but highly valuable resource. And now that you know you can hire in the Philippines, it will not break the bank either.

How can you Manage Remote Staff?
Effectively managing remote staff requires strong communication and coordination in the era of digital work. In order to successfully manage remote staff, here are some professional insights:

Advantages of Accountants in the Real Estate Business
The expertise of accountants in the real estate business can bring several advantages. Their contributions offer growth and success to real estate ventures. Here are some of the perks of having a good accountant for your real estate business:

Make informed decisions
Typically, real estate business owners are more focused on sales. This can result in a lack of attention to detail when it comes to accounting. Accountants help you make well-informed decisions with their expertise, analysis, and insights. They contribute strategic ideas to extract the most profit and minimize risks in the real estate industry.

 Risk management 
It's risky to overlook the return on investment (ROI) in your property management business. Knowing your revenue and income numbers by heart is crucial for running a successful business, despite the excitement they bring.
There are many pressures on real estate businesses. For instance, increased operating costs such as subscription fees, software expenses, and wages.
However, the commissions you charge are decreasing. And in some markets, property prices are declining. This can lead to lower transaction percentages.
Accountants assess risks' potential impact. This helps businesses make informed choices that minimize drawbacks and maximize returns.

 Financial Analysis
While you may be excited about the returns, you could be operating on a slim margin of 10% or even lower. For a profitable and robust business, you need a reliable accountant to devise strategies for a desired ROI range of 20-33%.
Accountants analyze financial data related to real estate investments, projects, and properties. They assess the financial capability of potential ventures and evaluate costs and benefits. Most importantly, they determine the ROI.

 Budgeting and Forecasting
Accountants assist in creating and maintaining budgets for real estate projects or ventures. They forecast income and expenses, taking into account various factors. This includes market conditions, financing costs, and operating expenses.

 Tax Planning
Real estate transactions have complex tax implications. Accountants with real estate tax expertise offer guidance on tax planning and maximizing benefits. They assist businesses in comprehending tax implications for decisions. This involves property acquisitions, sales, or rental income.

How will your Real Estate Accountant Work in Partnership with your Bookkeeper?
An accountant can work with your bookkeeper, ensuring that everything is entered correctly based on their advice. They create a chart of accounts to make sense for the accountant. But most importantly, it will be beneficial for you as the owner.

Real estate has specific areas where an ordinary accountant may lack understanding. For example, trust accounts, commission splits, and property advertising.

We have seen instances where property advertising gets mixed up with business advertising. These aspects should be treated separately. Property marketing expenses are typically billed to the seller and can be recovered. While business advertising costs should be categorized individually.

These are important to make sure you can have clear reporting and make good decisions. To ensure effective financial management, they can collaborate by:

Data Entry and Bookkeeping - The bookkeeper can enter data into the accounting software to keep track of daily financial transactions. This can help maintain accurate financial records and reconcile bank statements.
Financial Reporting -The real estate accountant can utilize the data maintained by the bookkeeper. This is so that they can generate comprehensive financial reports. They analyze financial information and prepare balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.
Exchange financial information - The real estate accountant and bookkeeper exchange financial information and maintain accurate records. They collaborate to resolve any discrepancies and address financial concerns. As a result, they can provide a clear picture of the business's financial position.

Can Real Estate Accountants Work Virtually?
Yes, a property accountant can certainly work virtually. This is particularly because most of the duties can be accomplished online. However, it's important to ensure that you have suitable systems in place.

A good example is providing software tools for effective financial reporting. At ShoreAgents, we take care of the following:

A well-defined job description to find suitable accountants for your real estate business. Afterward, we will present a shortlist of candidates for you to choose from.

Gaining team buy-in and helping remote team members to feel engaged at work. ShoreAgents celebrates work anniversaries, and birthdays, and encourages activity clubs & monthly games. 

Cost Comparison of Real Estate Accountants Globally
The primary factor affecting a real estate accountant's salary is their location. Although there are other considerations such as skillsets, experience, and specific duties. This means that if they live in high-cost-of-living areas, their wages are likely to be high as well.

As a result, several companies globally look for offshoring options. Let's take a look at the salary comparison of an accountant.

What does a Mortgage Virtual Assistant do?
Mortgage virtual assistants are essential for supporting the mortgage process, allowing professionals to concentrate on core business tasks. By handling administrative responsibilities and providing exceptional customer service, they contribute to increased efficiency and client satisfaction.

Mortgage VAs commonly perform repetitive tasks such as data entry and appointment scheduling among other tasks. However, this depends on the mortgage firm's requirements and business goals. The majority of mortgage firms create a list of tasks for their virtual staff overseas and set deadlines.

Duties and Responsibilities of a Mortgage VA
The mortgage process involves time-consuming tasks that can prolong the overall timeline. For instance, assessing a borrower's loan application documents to closing can generally be complex.

Each phase requires a keen eye for details and double-checking information on all submitted requirements. Not to mention other external factors involving interest rates or housing market trends, which may prolong the entire mortgage process further.

Therefore, to expedite the process and avoid further delays, this is where a virtual assistant walks into the picture. Check out the typical tasks of a mortgage virtual assistant:

Collection of Required Documents
Each borrower needs to submit the necessary documentation when applying for a loan. The mortgage VA will help verify the borrower's financial history. This includes the borrower's monthly income, employment history, and credit history among others.
Credit Evaluation
A mortgage VA collaborates with a mortgage underwriter to carefully assess borrowers' credit standing. The underwriting process thoroughly evaluates the borrower's financial profile and the property's value.
Property Assessment
An appraisal is important to evaluate the property's worth and ensure it meets the LTV requirements. A digital assistant helps in scheduling appraisals and waiting for the appraiser's report.
Loan Application Processing
In this process, the mortgage processor guarantees that all required information is complete. Depending on the complexity of the loan, this can take a longer time without a VA's help.
Loan Approval and Closing

Where to Outsource a Mortgage VA?
When it comes to outsourcing a mortgage VA for your real estate business, you have two main options to explore. Freelance platforms and a real estate Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) agency like ShoreAgents. 

Both choices offer distinct advantages, catering to your specific needs and preferences. Discover the following pros and cons to help you make an informed decision:

1. Freelance Platforms
Upwork, Freelancer, Fiverr, and other online freelance platforms offer an extensive talent pool, including Mortgage VAs. You can post your job requirements and gain access to various candidates. 

However, due to the global market, the expenses of hiring a freelancer have significantly increased. With the surge in remote work and online platforms, freelancers now have access to a broader market. 

This allows them to offer their services to clients worldwide and has resulted in a larger pool of freelancers. Therefore, this intensifies the competition for top talent. Consequently, highly skilled and sought-after freelancers may demand higher rates for their services.

Employees tend to stay longer with real estate outsourcing companies because of the stability and potential for career growth. This may not be as strong in the global market for freelancers. Beyond reliable income, employees can participate in engagement programs and feel a sense of belonging within the team.

In contrast, short-term freelancers can cost more for your business, as they often take on multiple projects and clients. This can lead to higher turnover rates, necessitating additional time and resources to find and onboard new employees.

2. Offshore BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) Company
Partnering with a real estate BPO agency like ShoreAgents can boost time and improve productivity. Our intensive recruitment process guarantees that we provide the best offshore staff for your business.

Construction virtual assistants are highly skilled professionals who provide remote support to construction firms. Their immense project management skills and support capabilities contribute to the overall success of each construction project.

While their duties vary accordingly, this function plays an essential role to fulfill construction-related tasks. For instance, some of the most time-consuming tasks that hold back construction firms are data entry and research. Instead of concentrating on various phases of construction, they may spend more time on these less important duties.

This is where virtual assistants enter the scene to lend a hand. They can manage schedules, track the progress of projects, and respond to client inquiries. Oftentimes, they also collaborate with other roles in the firm when necessary.

A construction VA can coordinate tasks with an engineer to ensure the fulfillment of engineering specifications. Similarly, working alongside an architect to communicate design-related tasks.

Tasks and Obligations of a Construction VA

Where to Outsource a Construction VA?
When outsourcing a construction VA for your real estate business, you have two main choices. Hiring through freelance platforms or a reliable real estate BPO agency like ShoreAgents.

Both options have unique benefits, tailored to your needs. Explore the pros and cons below to make an informed choice:

1. Freelance Platforms
Online freelance platforms like Upwork and Freelancer provide a wide range of talent. If you decide to hire on freelance platforms, you need to list your job requirements and connect with various candidates.

However, the global market has led to increased expenses for hiring freelancers.

Do note that short-term freelancers might cost more for your business, as they handle multiple projects and clients. This can lead to higher turnover rates, requiring more time and resources to find and onboard replacements.

Outsourced employees at real estate outsourcing companies often stay longer due to stability and career growth opportunities. This isn't as prevalent in the global freelancer market. Aside from a consistent income, employees can engage in programs and feel a sense of belonging.

2. Offshore BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) Company
Outsourcing a virtual assistant through a real estate BPO agency like ShoreAgents offers the advantage of streamlined recruitment. This ensures access to skilled professionals who are pre-screened for industry expertise. This approach provides businesses with a reliable source of talent while allowing them to focus on core operations and strategic growth.

Your virtual assistants at ShoreAgents will also enjoy working as they have access to enjoy quality facilities. Our modern office is further equipped with a backup power generator. We provide complete computers with dual screens, webcams, and headsets.

SECTORS
Real Estate Outsourcing: Definition and Tasks
Real Estate Outsourcing involves assigning real estate tasks to an external company or individual. This can include tasks such as property management, marketing, research, and administrative functions, among others. 

In essence, real estate outsourcing involves partnering with a third-party provider to handle specific aspects of the real estate business. This frees up valuable time and resources in order for companies to focus on their core competencies.

Outsourcing offers access to external expertise and resources to achieve business goals. It enhances efficiency, saves costs, and boosts productivity in real estate companies.

In short, real estate outsourcing is a smart way for real estate companies to leverage the knowledge and expertise of others. Through this, they improve their operations and stay ahead of the competition.

Commercial Real Estate Outsourcing
Typically, the trend in real estate outsourcing is focused on the residential sector and is more common in this area. However, that does not mean that outsourcing is not a viable option for commercial real estate companies. The benefits are the same, though the tasks may differ slightly. Virtual staff manages lease renewals for commercial offices and shops, while outsourcing is used for homes and apartments.

For a commercial real estate company looking to outsource, the process is the same. The first step is to identify tasks that are slowing down the company and are of low value. Then, determine how the commercial real estate virtual assistant can complete these tasks through proper processes and training.

Corporate Real Estate Outsourcing
Outsourcing in real estate isn’t just for small one-agent or team operations. Large corporate businesses can also reap the benefits of outsourcing and build an entire virtual workforce. For this reason, they can support their brand, franchises, agents, property managers, and more.

Large corporations often have hidden virtual teams handling tasks at a corporate level, without internal teams being aware. This efficient arrangement allows the corporate business to allocate time and resources to other crucial tasks.

For big brands or franchises, outsourcing real estate services and providing them under your brand is a smart move. It can reduce overhead costs across the entire corporation. At the same time, it provides more value to your team and helps them keep their enthusiasm and productivity.

So, if you’re a corporate real estate business looking to streamline your operations, outsourcing is definitely worth considering. With the right provider and processes, you can unlock the benefits of outsourcing and take your business to the next level.

How to Start Outsourcing in Real Estate?
Getting started with outsourcing in real estate can be easier than you think. A lack of knowledge can hinder progress, but it doesn't imply a lack of creativity. Hiring a Filipino virtual assistant can be scary if you’ve never done it before. However, keep in mind that they possess the capabilities to accomplish tasks like any other human.

Even without being physically present for inspections, tasks that can be done online or over the phone can still be managed. This can be made possible through proper training and processes. Here are some simple steps to get started:

Identify tasks that are slowing you down, repetitive, or of low value.
Categorize these tasks based on difficulty.
Look at all the tasks that you currently have a process for and select those that are easy to train. It's essential to create a work process if you don’t have one in place.
Draft a basic job role outline for the tasks you want to delegate.
Develop a training plan for when your worker begins.
Invest in productivity software, such as ClickUp or Monday, to manage your team from a distance.
Appoint someone to be responsible for leading your virtual team member, as they need direction just like your in-house employees.

If you require assistance to begin, feel free to contact us, and we'll gladly provide guidance throughout the process.

For example, simply stating “I need someone to handle my social media” is not enough. To effectively outsource your social media management, you need to be specific about the tasks you want to be done. This includes answering questions such as what photos to use, what quotes to include, and which hashtags to add.

Instead of utilizing vague information, it is imperative to provide specific and detailed instructions. For instance, “Create 25 Instagram posts using photos from this folder and quotes from the provided testimonials. Research appropriate hashtags and add 3-7 hashtags per post. After approval, schedule 5 posts per day using this Hootsuite account.”

By setting clear and defined goals, you’ll be able to measure your virtual assistant’s performance. Through this, you will be able to determine if they’re doing a good job. But keep in mind that outsourcing does require some investment in education and training to ensure success. This aids in identifying outsourced areas of your business and tasks suitable for delegation within the outsourcing framework.

The Importance of Approval Processes in Real Estate Outsourcing
When outsourcing tasks in real estate, one critical aspect that’s often overlooked is the approval process. Who in your organization will be responsible for reviewing and approving the work completed by your virtual assistant?

Your outsourced assistant operates without a conventional supervisor and may receive tasks from various staff members without direct oversight. Hence, implementing an approval process is essential to review each task before its release under your business's name.

There are various tools you can use to track task progress and ensure that an approval process is in place. Project management apps like Trello or Asana can help, or you can use a simple Excel spreadsheet. The key is to establish an accountability barrier between your virtual assistant and the public representation of your business.

Don’t neglect the importance of an approval process in real estate outsourcing. Implementing this ensures that your virtual assistant's work aligns with your standards and presents your business in the best possible light.

Are There Any Downsides to Outsourcing for Real Estate?
Outsourcing is a brilliant way to start trimming the fat from your business and make easy increases to your profit margin. As outlined already, though, there is still a bit of work involved for you. But if you understand your business, you can easily find the low-hanging fruit and start making cost savings immediately.

The best way to start outsourcing is slowly by starting with one or two simple tasks. It's advisable to hone your process and learn to better understand the system. You may prefer to work with people from one country over another. 

It is possible that you lack knowledge regarding the appropriate payment amount. You may not realize how difficult a particular task is. Starting out outsourcing can be a relatively low-cost investment, but don’t throw yourself into it all at once. Besides the research involved, there are other downsides that you need to be aware of.

Lack of Loyalty
Whether you hire someone directly through Upwork or via an agency, that person is not necessarily loyal to you. Even the most perfect person on Upwork can suddenly drop you as a client if they get a better offer. No contract between you forces them to give a certain period of notice. Regardless of their affinity for your brand, you are simply one of many clients they serve.

Inconstancy
When working with an agency, you’ll be drawing on a pool of specialists. This is great because it means the job will always get done, but you do also lose an element of control. Can we expect the current individual to perform as effectively as the previous individual did last month?

Will you have to remind them again that certain expenses need to be reconciled to a specific account? Yes, the agency should take care of that side. However, if you’re being assigned a different person each month, then you can’t be guaranteed consistency.

Loss of Privacy
Often you’ll need to share sensitive documents and data to get your tasks done by an outsourced person. Think of what they’ll need access to social media accounts, website passwords, back-end processes, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Docs, etc.

Certain programs enable you to restrict user access, preventing them from causing significant harm or carrying out unwanted actions. But as already mentioned, your outsourced worker doesn’t necessarily owe you any loyalty. Even if they sign an NDA if they release sensitive information about your business, can you pursue them legally?

Real Estate Outsourcing versus Offshoring Explained
Outsourcing entails delegating specific parts of your back office to an individual or group for completion. It is task-specific and there is a different type of outsourcing called offshoring. 
This is where you hire an offshore employee to join your team. If they are supporting one member of your domestic team, they are usually referred to as a real estate virtual assistant. 

Although an offshore employee will be responsible for a number of different tasks, their role is usually not task-specific. Just like any of your other staff, they fulfill a role, not just a task. So whereas outsourcing is task-specific, an offshore employee is role-specific.

Moving from Outsourcing to Offshoring
In our experience, a real estate business will typically outsource a specific task for a defined period of time. A good example is lease renewals. A real estate agency finds that it has fallen behind in this area. 

They hire an offshore team member through an outsourcing company to handle lease renewals for 3 to 6 months. The contracting company is accountable for training, supervising, and overseeing the progress of this task on a daily basis.

Keep in mind that in this example, the person assigned to your business is not your employee. However, they will be working only on your business so there are fewer problems associated with loyalty. 

Real estate companies often explore outsourcing as they contemplate their offshore requirements. However, the complexity of their needs may surpass their suitability. While outsourcing works well for the aforementioned tasks, there may come a point where a full-time staff member becomes necessary.

If you’re looking for a full-time offshore staff member to join your team, you should be searching for offshoring. For a lot of businesses, this is the next step after outsourcing. As mentioned, this is when you hire an offshore employee to join your team.

Real Estate Outsourcing & Offshoring Trends for 2023
The year has started off strong, witnessing a significant surge in remote staffing compared to the previous year. Now that the pandemic seems to finally be under control, businesses are returning to normal operations. 

However, there are still some pressures on the global real estate industry. This includes declining volumes, rising interest rates, and other factors, which are putting pressure on businesses. This is why companies are now turning to outsourcing in the Philippines, even those who have never considered it before. We expect this trend to continue and hope to see you join us on this journey.

Mortgage Process Outsourcing Services & Solutions

The mortgage industry's constant evolution is driving lenders and financial institutions to seek sustainable growth by analyzing market trends. Mortgage companies experience fluctuations in the housing market and are looking for ways to overcome certain challenges.

For instance, changes in regulatory requirements demand them to closely monitor compliance to prevent costly violations. Allocating budget is important for mortgage companies to ensure their adherence to laws and reporting requirements. There are also operational and staffing costs, along with technology platforms and software expenses to consider.

Budget constraints due to economic factors also highly impact the profitability of mortgage companies. And for this reason, they look for strategic financial planning to guarantee long-term success in the mortgage industry.

This is where real estate outsourcing steps in to enhance the effectiveness of the mortgage process. As a business owner, it's difficult to carry all the weight on your shoulders. You may find yourself focusing on time-consuming & non-core activities instead of looking at revenue projections and developing business plans.

The digital era has now allowed mortgage firms to delegate laborious tasks to enhance the efficiency of their operations. Building a team to do mortgage underwriting, loan processing, accounting, and other roles has never been this easier.

Without a doubt, outsourcing has helped several mortgage firms to reduce high-volume duties and improve overall productivity. If you are interested to learn more about leading a successful mortgage outsourcing service, then this article is for you.

What is Mortgage Process Outsourcing?
Mortgage process outsourcing involves assigning tasks to a specialized team of experts to handle the mortgage process. Due to the increased demands of borrowers and other factors, mortgage lenders may experience poor turnaround time and mismanaged document systems.

As the borrower's demand grows and industry policies change, mortgage lenders turn to mortgage process outsourcing services to manage scale. In simpler terms, when a borrower applies for a mortgage, an external team handles the tedious tasks on their behalf. This includes preparing all the necessary paperwork, communicating with the borrower, reviewing their financial information, and the list goes on.

Instead of the mortgage lender working on these tasks, a reliable external company will accomplish them on their behalf. ShoreAgents is a leading real estate staffing & Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) company that specializes in mortgage services.

Whether you need to hire one agent or create a workforce to accomplish mortgage-related tasks, we have your back. Our success team at ShoreAgents ensures that you onboard the most qualified staff to streamline your operations.



Benefits of Mortgage Process Outsourcing Services
In general, outsourcing offers several benefits that mortgage companies can take advantage of. Learning about the advantages of outsourcing can help you make informed business decisions. Here are some of the benefits of mortgage process outsourcing:

Minimized Lead Time
Depending on the complexity of mortgage transactions, the process usually involves time-consuming tasks. From document verification to post-closing activities, an outsourced real estate virtual assistant can help complete these faster and more accurately.
Through this, you can keep up with the increasing demand and gain the flexibility to meet deadlines. Having a swift and reliable process can also attract more borrowers, which contributes to your business's profitability.

High-Quality Results 
Delegating the heavy lifting of mortgage work to experts guarantees high-quality and accurate results. Particularly when you partner with an outsourcing company with experience in mortgage-related tasks and expertise in compliance.
You can guarantee that your business stays updated with changing mortgage regulations. This also boomerangs to minimizing expenses, reducing the risk of errors, and avoiding penalties.

Achieve Cost Savings
Reducing operational costs without sacrificing the quality of work is possible through outsourcing. In comparison to hiring in-person staff, you get access to a global talent pool at a lower cost. You may also need to put up an office for in-person staff, which outsourcing companies like ShoreAgents already provide.
This is why outsourcing in the Philippines is getting more popular. Aside from the fact that it offers cost-efficient solutions, the country is also proud of its highly-skilled workforce. At ShoreAgents, all you have to worry about is identifying the tasks and training, while we take care of the rest.

Concentrate on Core Strengths 
Mortgage services demand niche skills that require specialized knowledge and comprehension. For instance, an escrow officer facilitates a smooth and efficient closing process throughout a mortgage transaction. Having a keen eye for details is essential for reviewing documents which can take up most of your time.
Outsourcing non-core duties will allow you to focus on your main responsibilities. For instance, managing compliance risks and expanding your customer base. This enables mortgage companies to maximize returns and progress without further distractions on tasks that matter less.

Access to Advanced Technology
Outsourcing companies often invest in mortgage automation and other real estate software productivity tools. Part of their services gives you access to the latest innovations without paying for membership or upgrading costs.

What are the Outsourcing Services for Property Managers and Property Management Companies?
With property management services outsourced, property management companies can tap into the expertise and specialized knowledge of virtual assistants. This results in a cost-effective solution with access to advanced technology and enhance productivity. 

Outsourcing certain tasks such as maintenance coordination and tenant inquiries can help property managers focus on income-generating tasks. They can prioritize sales, client relationships, and business expansion.

It is a known fact that property managers can generate more income by handling hundreds or even thousands of properties. And while that sounds rewarding, time-consuming tasks are expected to pile up as the business grows. This explains why property managers and property management companies are seeking to outsource various aspects of their operations.

By having a dedicated team of professionals, they can significantly improve the operations' efficiency by reducing time and paperwork. These team members, serving as virtual property management assistants, are skilled in handling the complexities of property management. Their support will result in increased proficiency as they take care of non-core tasks. 

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Property managers and property management companies outsource diverse functions in their operations to increase efficiency and productivity. 
There are several back-office tasks that can be outsourced to optimize the property management processes. This includes but is not limited to, property bookkeeping, marketing campaigns, and administrative support.
Outsourcing back-office operations can help business owners to save approximately 70% cost savings. In comparison to hiring locally, you will need to consider increased labor expenses and other overhead costs.

What Back-office Tasks Can Property Managers Outsource?
In general, property management companies outsource various repetitive administrative tasks to streamline their operations. Depending on the company's specific needs and goals, they can outsource several functions. 

For instance, they may hire a customer service representative for tenant/landlord support or a property management accountant to collect rent.

Your outsourced staff with ShoreAgents can help with the following back-end administration part of this process:

Pre-Listing
The pre-listing phase plays a crucial role in setting the stage for a successful property management business. This phase encompasses various essential tasks that property managers undertake to secure new properties under their management. Some of the pre-listing tasks involve the following:

Lead Generation - this is vital as property managers actively seek potential rental properties for management. 
Market Research - property managers analyze the local real estate market and gather insights through market research. This helps them determine the competitive landscape. At the same time, rental rates and potential demand for specific property types. 
Approaching Landlords - property managers proactively communicate and build relationships with landlords. They will reach out to landlords who may have properties that could benefit from property management services.
Property Assessments - this process is important for property managers to provide accurate information to landlords and set realistic expectations. It also involves evaluating the property's condition and identifying potential property maintenance.
Presenting Management Proposals - this task involves outlining comprehensive management plans and services tailored to the specific property. It includes marketing plans, tenant screening processes, and financial reporting among others. 

The pre-listing phase also involves tasks such as going through terms and conditions and signing the management agreement document. Afterward, the property management phase begins. This is where property managers take over the day-to-day management tasks to ensure overall property performance and success. 

Listing
The listing phase is where property managers prepare and showcase a property for rent. During this phase, a series of tasks are undertaken to ensure a smooth and successful rental process. Here are the tasks that you can outsource in the listing process:

Determine Property Rent - setting an appropriate rental price varies according to the location, property size, and current market conditions. Property managers will have to conduct market research in order to maximize the return on investment.
Organize Photos and Marketing Materials - appealing photos that highlight the property's features will certainly attract potential tenants. It will also involve writing detailed property descriptions and featuring the property's unique selling points if there are any.
Advertise the Property -  Advertising is important in order to reach a wide audience of prospective tenants. This is where property managers use social media and other platforms to promote the property. They will post the listings on the agency's website, real estate websites, and various social media channels. The advertisement includes the schedule of the open house, the soonest availability for the property, and the rent required. In addition to this, photos and a description of the properties are also included.
Respond to Inquiries - once the property is listed everywhere, there will be several inquiries from interested tenants. Addressing their questions and scheduling property inspections or open houses will allow them to view the property.
Receiving tenancy applications from prospective tenants - This process involves reviewing the applications & conducting background checks to assess the applicant's profile. Your offshore team member can review the applicants' cost-effectiveness ratio and contact their previous tenancies. This way, they can check if they have maintained their previous rental in exemplary condition. At the same time, identify if they have been diligent in paying their rent on time.
Approving a tenant for the property - the property manager will approve tenants on behalf of the landlord. This will be based on the results of the reference and affordability checks.
Organizing reservation fees and bond lodgement - collecting the funds from the tenant and securing the rental bond as per local regulations.
Lease preparation - this is a crucial task involving the property managers who will draft and review the lease agreement. The document will ensure that all legal requirements and terms are reflected. Your offshore team can prepare the Tenancy Agreement on your behalf. They will also make sure to input all tenant details in your real estate management software before the move-in date.
Incoming inspection &  preparing incoming condition report - Prior to tenant move-in, an incoming inspection will be conducted. Property managers will prepare an incoming condition report and note any existing damages or issues.
Saving all tenant files into the system - for organizing the records, all important files will be stored for easy access.

In Tenancy
This phase involves consistent communication with tenants and handling repairs and maintenance. Effective tenant communication is essential throughout the tenancy period. This is so that property managers can promptly address any concerns raised by tenants. Check out the tasks that you can outsource during the in-tenancy process:

Arrears Management - this involves payment reminders and formal notices. This includes monitoring rent payments and taking action to address arrears. 
Maintenance and repairs - to ensure that the property remains in good condition, property managers respond to maintenance requests from tenants. 
Periodic Inspections - to assess the property's condition during the tenancy, periodic inspections are conducted.  
Lease renewals - property managers communicate with tenants to discuss lease renewal options. This will ensure a seamless transition from one tenancy term to another.
Rent Reviews - these are conducted to assess and adjust the rental price based on market conditions and other factors.
Termination of tenancy - in compliance with applicable laws and lease agreements, termination may be necessary. This involves returning keys and security deposit.

An outgoing inspection will also be conducted upon the tenant's vacate. This report will be compared to the incoming inspection report to assess tenant liability for damages. It will also indicate any deductions from the rental bond before refunding.

Construction Outsourcing and Property Development Strategies in the Philippines: Boosting Efficiency and Cost Savings
Construction and property development companies are increasingly turning to outsourcing as a strategic approach to streamline operations, reduce costs, and accelerate project timelines. By delegating specialized tasks to external experts, these companies can focus on their core competencies while benefiting from the expertise and cost-effectiveness of outsourcing partners. In this article, we will explore the benefits of construction outsourcing and property development strategies, with a particular focus on the Philippines as an outsourcing destination.

Tasks that Construction and Property Development Companies Can Outsource
Contract Administration
Managing contracts is a complex task that requires legal expertise. By outsourcing contract administration, companies can ensure legal protection without the need for an in-house legal team. This allows them to focus on their core business activities while ensuring compliance and risk mitigation.

Off the Plan Marketing
Marketing properties that are yet to be constructed, also known as "off the plan" marketing, requires a different approach. Specialized agencies can create virtual tours and high-quality marketing materials that allow prospective buyers to visualize the final product. Outsourcing off the plan marketing ensures professional and compelling marketing campaigns that attract pre-sale interest.

Sales Support
Sales are vital to the success of construction and property development projects. By outsourcing tasks like lead management and customer relationship management (CRM), companies can ensure a professional and consistent approach to sales without the need for in-house resources. This allows them to focus on strategic tasks while maintaining a strong sales presence.

Handling Property Enquiry
Customer inquiries often require immediate attention, but handling them internally can be time-consuming. Outsourced call centers or AI-based chatbots can efficiently filter and handle customer inquiries, passing on only those that require specialized attention. This ensures prompt and effective customer service without overwhelming internal resources.

Property Research
The success of a property development project relies heavily on thorough research. Specialized research firms can provide valuable insights into market trends, site feasibility, and regulatory landscapes. By outsourcing property research, companies can access expert knowledge and mitigate risks associated with inadequate research.

Project Management
Construction and development projects involve numerous moving parts that require careful coordination. Outsourcing project management to specialized firms ensures that projects stay on schedule and within budget, allowing the main company to focus on strategic tasks and overall project strategy.

Graphic Design
The visual representation of a project is crucial in attracting clients and buyers. Graphic design agencies can create compelling visual assets such as logos, branding materials, and architectural renderings. By outsourcing graphic design, companies can ensure professional and visually appealing presentations that leave a lasting impression.

Property Advertising
Advertising is a highly specialized area that requires expertise in media buying and copywriting. Media buying agencies can help companies get the most value out of their advertising budgets, while copywriters can craft messages that resonate with the target audience. Outsourcing property advertising ensures effective and targeted marketing campaigns.

Social Media Marketing
Maintaining a consistent and engaging social media presence is essential in today's digital age. Content creation agencies can handle social media management, creating and posting content that resonates with the target audience. By outsourcing social media marketing, companies can benefit from a professional online presence without the need for day-to-day management.

Coordinating with Local Councils
Navigating the bureaucracy of local councils can be complicated and time-consuming. Hiring liaison officers or external firms that specialize in coordinating with local councils can expedite the process of obtaining necessary permits and approvals. Outsourcing this task ensures efficient communication and compliance with local regulations.

In summary, outsourcing specialized tasks in construction and property development allows companies to focus on their core competencies while benefiting from the expertise and cost-effectiveness of external partners. By outsourcing tasks such as contract administration, off the plan marketing, sales support, property research, project management, graphic design, property advertising, social media marketing, and coordinating with local councils, companies can optimize efficiency, reduce costs, and accelerate project timelines.

Evaluating BPO Providers for Construction and Property Development Outsourcing
When selecting a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) partner for construction and property development outsourcing, it is crucial to consider the following factors:

Sector Expertise
Choose a BPO that has verifiable experience in the construction and property sector. This ensures that the sourced staff have baseline competencies in the field.

Talent Acquisition & Skillsets
Inquire about the BPO's screening mechanisms for new hires. A high-standard recruitment procedure should prioritize individuals with basic know-how in construction and a willingness to undergo further training.

Interpersonal Abilities
Effective communication and critical thinking skills are essential for remote work, particularly in the construction and property sector. Prioritize BPOs that emphasize these traits in their hiring process.

Technological Capabilities
Confirm that the BPO's hardware capabilities are reliable and meet your project's needs, whether it's CAD software or project management tools. Additionally, ensure that the sourced staff can navigate the software tools you currently utilize or plan to implement.

Operational Setting
Clarify where the outsourced staff will be located. This will influence not just training logistics but also how you intend to manage the team.

Governance & Oversight
Determine the available platforms for regular interactions between you and the outsourced team, especially those that facilitate easy transfer of training material and feedback. Inquire if the BPO offers supervisory assistance or if the management of the outsourced team is your sole responsibility.

Legal & Contractual Clauses
Make sure the agreement is unambiguous concerning the duties and responsibilities you will undertake, notably training. Verify that the contract is accommodating, permitting you to adjust the size of the outsourced team or modify services according to changing requirements.

Reputational Aspects
Look for a BPO that has garnered favorable reviews for professionalism, adherence to quality standards, and the efficacy of their recruitment practices. Customer testimonials can provide valuable insights into the BPO's reputation and reliability.

By carefully evaluating these factors, construction and property development companies can select a BPO partner that aligns with their strategic goals and ensures successful outsourcing outcomes.

Construction and Property Development Outsourcing vs. Offshoring to BPOs
While construction and property development outsourcing and offshoring to BPOs may seem similar, there are key distinctions between the two approaches:

Construction and Property Development Outsourcing
Task-Oriented: Outsourcing typically focuses on specific tasks or projects, such as environmental assessments or site surveys.
Skill-Centric: Outsourcing often targets specific skills that may be lacking in-house, such as cost estimation or zoning law expertise.
Arm's Length Engagement: External contributors may not deeply integrate with the client's team, offering a more detached form of collaboration.
Short to Mid-Range Timeframe: Outsourcing tends to cater to immediate needs but can extend depending on the project's scope.
Geographical Flexibility: Outsourcing can take place within the same country or internationally, depending on skill availability and budget constraints.
Expertise Assumed: Outsourced workers are expected to be self-sufficient with little need for training.
Billing Mechanisms: Payment often corresponds to project milestones or specific outputs.
Oversight Level: Client involvement in project management can vary but usually adheres to pre-defined project scopes.

Construction and Property Development Offshoring to BPOs
Staff-Centric: BPOs usually offer part-time or full-time staff dedicated solely to the client's needs.
Broad Service Spectrum: BPO employees can manage an array of functions from basic clerical tasks to specialized construction-related responsibilities.
Highly Integrated: BPO employees closely align with the client's existing workforce, sharing tools, data, and communication platforms.
Long-Term Collaboration: Offshoring is generally better suited for ongoing, perpetual needs rather than one-off projects.
Geographical Constraints: Offshoring involves sending work to countries with more affordable labor costs.
Client-Provided Training: The onus of specialized training often lies with the client.
Retainer-Based Costs: Payments are often structured as ongoing fees, depending on the number of employees engaged.
Hands-On Management: Clients usually play an active role in team oversight, especially when specialized training is needed.

The choice between construction and property development outsourcing and offshoring to BPOs depends on project requirements, desired level of integration, and long-term collaboration goals.

Legal Process Outsourcing for Conveyancing Firms
The complex tasks associated with real estate settlement and closing processes make it difficult for firms to streamline their operations. Not to mention the challenges of maintaining client satisfaction and the associated costs of hiring in-person staff. As property markets thrive in the industry, the need for real estate outsourcing services becomes the ultimate solution.

Particularly, the function of a conveyancer is crucial in ensuring that the settlement and closing process is efficient and valid. From title searches to guiding clients through legal implications, they specialize in overseeing real estate transactions.

While hiring an in-person staff for this function is an option, there are also operational & staffing costs to consider. Fortunately, the digital era has conveniently made outsourcing conveyancers easier for a legally sound transfer of property ownership. In fact, hiring a conveyancer along with a proficient virtual transaction coordinator can even expedite the closing process further.

The primary advantage of outsourcing is that you can focus on your core duties to improve your business. You can simply delegate tasks to a virtual assistant or even create a workforce to streamline your overall operations. This article will cover the duties, advantages, cost analysis of outsourcing conveyancing services, and more.

The Function of Conveyancers in Real Estate Transactions
Conveyancers are essential in streamlining and expediting real estate transactions. Their expertise allows a seamless and legally compliant transfer of property ownership. Here are some of the valuable contributions of conveyancers in every real estate transaction:

Due Diligence - Adhering to local regulations requires conveyancers to investigate the property's title history. This process helps identify any potential legal issues that may occur and guarantees a smooth process.
Detailed Review of Legal Documents - Conveyancers draft and review each legal document to ensure accuracy. This includes contracts, agreements, and transfer deeds which reflect the terms of the transaction.
Risk Reduction - Carefully examining potential legal pitfalls, conveyancers scrutinize issues such as unpaid taxes or property restrictions like zoning. Their role is to minimize the risks and potential disputes and comply with the legal requirements.
Communication & Collaboration - Conveyancers act as intermediaries between buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and other stakeholders. They ensure the involvement of all concerned parties by coordinating with them in the process.
Title Transfer and Settlement - When everything is ready, conveyancers ensure the successful transfer of the property. They also manage funds, ensure proper document delivery, and guarantee property transfer to the new owner.

For corporations engaged in property transactions, outsourcing to a trusted conveyancing firm can optimize efficiency. This enables them to concentrate on their core business while experts manage legal intricacies. Similarly, law firms specializing in other areas of law might outsource conveyancing services to real estate law experts.

You can also outsource a conveyancer and delegate payment-related tasks such as stamp duty and taxation. Working alongside a property bookkeeper can also efficiently manage the financial aspects of property transactions.

Advantages of Outsourcing Conveyancers
The overhead costs and recruitment process associated with hiring in-person conveyancers can be challenging. Imagine that instead of focusing on major tasks, you need to spend time on hiring that may not be your expertise.

You may also need to pay higher overhead costs for an in-person staff which can strain your budget. The good news is that outsourcing is an excellent alternative to this traditional hiring process. Let's take a look at some of the perks to help you make the best decisions for your business:

Optimize Finances - Opting for outsourced conveyancers is ideal for a cost-efficient solution. Particularly in countries offering low labor costs like the Philippines, you can expect to pay less and save more.

For instance, the price of hiring a virtual assistant costs three times more in other first-world countries. This includes the USA, Australia, and UK among others. Whereas if you outsource in the Philippines, you can even potentially hire 2-3 workers for the price of one.

Access to Expertise - If you're looking to access a talent pool of professionals, outsourcing is definitely the answer. There are plenty of skilled individuals with extensive knowledge of property law that can guarantee successful completion of tasks.

However, it is still necessary to train your outsourced staff on your daily processes in order to meet your goals. For instance, outsourced staff may not be familiar with city-specific regulations and requirements. You may also need to spend time on familiarizing them with local laws.

Improve Process Efficiency - Virtual conveyancers are experts in risk mitigation strategies. They help minimize the chances of errors and legal issues which can cost your business more.

Through outsourcing, you can also streamline the conveyancing process by leveraging advanced technologies. This includes using cloud-based software for document management for a more organized transaction.

Focus on Core Duties - By outsourcing non-core activities like conveyancing, you can allocate more time and resources to your primary business functions. This can significantly improve your overall competitiveness and market positioning.

At the same time, inquiries from existing and potential clients will not go unnoticed. As you work on the major tasks that fuel the business, you can delegate client inquiries to your virtual conveyancer.

Flexibility of Workload - Outsourcing providers can customize conveyancing services to align with the specific requirements of each transaction. This allows flexibility and easy scaling up or down based on workload fluctuations.

During peak periods, such as high real estate transaction seasons, outsourcing allows you to scale up your conveyancing operations. You no longer need to hire more staff as this flexibility can help you manage fluctuations in demand more effectively.

The expertise of legal process outsourcing companies streamlines processes, reduces the risk of errors, and accelerates transaction timelines. This allows stakeholders to allocate their resources wisely. Not only will you be focusing on core activities, but also benefit from the specialized knowledge of conveyancing experts.

In-House Conveyancers vs Outsourcing through BPO Agency
In this section, we will feature expert insights on outsourcing options to help you make the best decision. Continue reading to learn more about hiring in-house conveyancers vs outsourcing through a real estate BPO agency like ShoreAgents.

Hiring an in-house conveyancing team can be more expensive depending on various factors. Their overall work experience is one factor, but the location majorly affects the overall salary.

If you hire locally, you will need to consider the median wage for the role. For instance, the average annual salary of a property assessor in the USA costs approximately $62,860 USD. This excludes benefits, office space, and equipment. Not to mention other costs associated with recruitment and training, which can be burdensome.

Whereas if you outsource in the Philippines, you can expect to pay $19, 537 USD annually. This already includes the salary, office space, facilities and equipment, health benefits, and our fees at ShoreAgents.

During seasons with a low volume of transactions, it can be challenging to keep in-person staff on the payroll. Considering that they offer higher fixed costs compared to outsourcing through a real estate BPO firm like ShoreAgents.

Outsourced staff members can also easily scale based on demand and offers long-term cost analysis. Apart from having access to global talent, you can enjoy established systems. You no longer need to invest in real estate software and tools which requires more costs. 

Factors to Consider when Selecting an Outsourcing Agency
When considering where to avail legal process outsourcing services, it’s important to conduct thorough research. Look for firms or professionals with the following:

Strong track record - Outsourcing firms with a strong track record give assurance that they have a history of successful collaborations. This simply presents years of expertise in their field to deliver high-quality staffing services.
Positive client reviews - It's true what they say about how reviews speak for the company itself. Positive insights from clients reflect a firm's established reputation and commitment to satisfying customers. 
Relevant expertise - Industry-specific knowledge is very important as it impacts the success of your projects. Partnering with an outsourcing agency with relevant experience guarantees that the staff you onboard are familiar with the industry trends. At the same time, they can offer the best practices and solutions that align with your business objectives.
Transparent pricing structures - Providing a detailed breakdown of costs showcases professionalism and builds trust. This also helps your firm to strategize in financial planning and decision-making. 

At ShoreAgents, we provide the best real estate staffing solutions for the real estate industry. Our success team demonstrates a commitment to excellence that translates into tangible results. With our fruitful years in the real estate industry, we value client satisfaction and understand your outsourcing needs. Whether you need to hire one agent, build a team, or create a workforce - we have you covered.

Where to Avail Outsourcing Conveyancing Services?
Several businesses turn to outsourcing conveyancing services due to the various advantages they offer. We already know that it can potentially save you money, but what are the available alternatives? Let's take a look at the expert insights below to help you make an informed outsourcing decision. 

Freelance Conveyancers
These are independent experts that provide freelance conveyancing services. While this can yield cost savings, it's crucial to thoroughly validate their credentials and previous work experience. 

You should also think about the possibility that hiring a freelancer could cost more. The current trend of freelancing has resulted in higher competition, so they may demand higher rates for their services.

Even when you're considering hiring a virtual assistant in the Philippines, it might turn out to be considerably more expensive. Take, for instance, our offer at ShoreAgents for a full-time real estate virtual assistant costs $1,191 USD per month. Hiring a full-time freelancer can potentially incur higher costs which can be around $2,720 USD per month.

The hourly rate for a Philippine-based conveyancing virtual assistant is $17 USD. Assuming that the freelancer works 40 hours per week full-time, the weekly cost would be $680 USD. This excludes additional expenses like statutory government benefits and insurance.

Most importantly, freelancers are not dedicated to your business alone. They usually work on different projects at the same time so their turnaround time may be slower. 

In addition to this, training can be more complex if they only have minimal work experience in the industry. You can certainly find the best candidate with relevant experience but will need to spend time reviewing all the applications. 

Real Estate BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) Firm
With BPO firms, you benefit from a structured workflow and consistent quality control. This may be lacking when you rely on individual freelancers who might have varying work styles and standards.

Essentially, real estate BPO firms like ShoreAgents offer customized solutions to your changing business needs. We can also adjust our resources to match transaction volumes during peak periods.

You no longer need to worry about investing in technology tools, as your offshore team already utilizes them. As well as overhead costs involving office space and work equipment? We also have that covered for your outsourced staff.

ShoreAgents is a real estate BPO firm that offers a wealth of industry-specific expertise. Our proven track record of successful real estate staffing can proudly offer the best candidates you can find in the market.

You no longer need to spend time on tedious recruitment duties and wonder whether or not you hired the right candidate. All you have to do is pinpoint the role and tasks to delegate and we take care of the rest.

This includes candidate search, assessment, interview, onboarding, and staff engagement. Our success team will assist during the interview process to ensure that you're onboarding the best among the rest. Outsourcing through a real estate BPO agency offers a more streamlined process that outshines freelancers.

Conclusion
To sum up, legal processing outsourcing for conveyancers presents a strategic strategy for effectively navigating the complex realm of property transactions. The decision to outsource signifies a commitment to optimizing resources and ensuring that property transactions unfold seamlessly.

ShoreAgents offers expert real estate staffing assistance. Our success team provides comprehensive support services across membership tiers to ensure a fruitful outsourcing journey for your organization.

This is by hiring a virtual real estate sales assistant who lives and works in a low-cost location.

A ShoreAgent real estate sales assistant is based in the Philippines, with low labor costs and a competent, well-educated workforce.

Can a Real Estate Sales Assistant work virtually?
The answer is yes, as long as you’re willing to set up your processes and tools for success.

The tools you’ll need depend on the tasks you want the assistant to perform. The tools could include the following:

Clearly written processes

Local Sales Assistant Vs. Virtual Sales Assistant
Employing a virtual real estate sales assistant offers numerous benefits in comparison to hiring a local real estate sales assistant, as it provides greater flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and access to a wider pool of talent, among other advantages.

Cost
Cost is a significant advantage if you hire offshore in a location such as the Philippines. You’ll receive quality support from your sales agents, but you’ll pay considerably less than you would for a local retail sales assistant.

Specialist Skills

Ease

Disadvantages
The only potential downside to hiring a virtual real estate sales assistant is that you will need to make some slight adjustments to how you work as a team. You’ll want to include the assistant in sales meetings. 

And you’ll need to prioritize the tasks you want them to do using the task management tool. ShoreAgents can coach you through the adjustment process. After a short time, you’ll forget that you ever operated any other way.

The advantages of a virtual real estate sales assistant are significant and the decisions are at the tip of your fingers.

Real Estate Sales Assistant Role
Here is a list of the principal duties you might assign to a real estate sale assistant. We’ve put a check next to each one that the assistant could do virtually with the proper technology.

Answering the phone and making follow-up calls if necessary

Interviewing applicants
Conducting background checks
Negotiating salary
Buying a computer and finding desk space
Hiring someone

Local Sales Administration Coordinator Vs. Virtual Sales Administration Coordinator
Before you decide whether to hire a local sales admin coordinator or a virtual one, let’s compare them. Here are the advantages of hiring a virtual sales admin coordinator.

Cost
You’ll save money by hiring a virtual sales admin coordinator offshore, such as in the Philippines. You could use that extra money to hire another virtual assistant, for extra marketing, or as a bonus for your staff. Even though you’ll be paying less, you’ll still receive the services of a competent, well-educated sales admin coordinator.

Specialist Skills
Real estate sales admin coordination is a specialized skill. It requires knowledge of real estate, as well as computer knowledge and organizational skills. 

ShoreAgents is the only BPO provider managed daily by an experienced real estate business owner. ShoreAgents will provide you with job candidates who have all the specialized skills you need.

Ease

You just have to tell us about your company and the type of person you hope to hire. We will contact you to confirm the details before commencing the recruitment process. Then we’ll recruit from our vast network to find you a small group to interview. You interview the group and choose the best virtual sales admin coordinator for your business.

Better Retention
Retaining good employees is difficult in the competitive real estate environment. ShoreAgents can improve your retention. Our sales admin coordinators work in a modern, comfortable work environment with other employees that hold similar roles at other companies. 

They learn best practices from each other, and we provide them with ongoing education. Real estate staffing is our business. We know how to keep employees engaged and happy so they’ll stay with you!

Downside
The only possible downside is that you’ll need to adapt to hybrid work culture. The coordinator will be a full member of your team but located off-premises. 

So, you’ll need to make some adjustments to include them in your team meetings. And you’ll need to prioritize the tasks you want them to do using a cloud-based tool. ShoreAgents can coach you and your coordinator through the adjustment process.

The advantages of a virtual sales admin coordinator are significant. However, the final decision is at the tip of your fingers. You decide whether the cost savings, specialized skills, ease, and better retention are worth learning to work hybrid. If you’re ready, we can help you make the relationship work for your team.

What are the duties of a Sales Administration Coordinator?
A sales admin coordinator performs the back-office tasks necessary to complete a sales transaction. They free up the agents’ time to sell or acquire more clients. You can decide the specific duties that are most important to you. ShoreAgents will recruit based on your staffing requirements.

Handle contracts and other documents related to the sale
Maintain an electronic filing system for storing sales-related documents
Respond to queries by letter, email, or phone
Create MLS listings for properties
Coordinate the sales team by managing schedules

Sales Administration Coordinator Role
Here is a list of the principal duties you might assign to a sales admin coordinator. We’ve put a check next to each one that the sales administration coordinator could do virtually with the proper technology. We’ve put a cross mark for in-person tasks. 

Handing contracts and other sales documents
Listing properties on MLS
Designing marketing materials
Monitoring the status of properties for sale
Creating an electronic system for filing documents
Respond to queries by email, phone, or letter
Coordinate the sales team

A sales administration coordinator is an ideal job to outsource. This is because the majority of the job tasks can be executed effectively in a virtual setting with the proper tools. ShoreAgents can assist you in obtaining those tools.

Where to hire a Sales Administration Coordinator?
Everything points to hiring a virtual sales administrative coordinator through ShoreAgents.
You’ll save time by not having to go through a laborious hiring process locally.

You’ll be able to scale your business without having to significantly increase your overhead.
You won’t have to arrange a workspace and computer for your virtual employee since ShoreAgents takes care of that.
You’ll be much more likely to retain your virtual employee than you will your local one. Back-office jobs can make members feel lonely and isolated. If you don’t have other employees performing similar jobs, back office employees may disengage and look for other employment. However, your virtual assistant will work with others in a welcoming, modern environment at ShoreAgents.

Takeaway
A sales administration coordinator's role involves managing sales data, processing orders, and maintaining customer relationships. Their salary varies by location, industry, and experience, but they play a crucial role in a company's sales team. 

The job outlook is positive, with growing demand for skilled professionals. It's a rewarding opportunity for those seeking a challenging and dynamic sales role.

We can save you time and money while helping you hire and retain an excellent virtual sales administration coordinator. Are you looking for just one part-time sales administration coordinator or a whole team of real estate professionals? We can fulfill these according to your business needs!

Of course, you could continue to do hiring the old-fashioned way. You could post the coordinator job yourself and cull through thousands of irrelevant applications to find a few to interview. Then you could set up interviews and finally hire someone that you end up paying at local market rates.

You can create a workspace in your office, which may occupy a room that could otherwise be utilized for client meetings. You may also purchase a computer and desk. However, there is a risk that your sales administrative coordinator may depart for a competitor after being trained and settling in.

Upon consideration of all the factors involved, it would be wise to make a modern choice. By partnering with ShoreAgents, you can save significant costs and time while scaling your business.

We are ShoreAgents, your real estate offshore staffing experts. When you partner with us, you’ll save time and money and scale your business.

Local Inside Sales Agent Vs. Virtual Inside Sales Agent
Before deciding to hire a virtual inside sales agent, you’ll likely want to understand the advantages of the virtual inside sales agent compared to the in-person inside agent. Here are the benefits a virtual inside sales agent offers.

Reduced Expenditure
The cost differential presents a substantial advantage if you opt to outsource offshore to a destination such as the Philippines, as it guarantees high-quality work at a fraction of the expense incurred for hiring a local inside sales agent.

Expertise
An inside sales agent specializes in generating, qualifying, and converting leads until they are ready to sell or buy a property. 

We possess the capability to supply agents equipped with specialized skills owing to two primary reasons: firstly, our extensive network of contacts in the real estate industry in the Philippines, and secondly, ShoreAgents is the only BPO provider that has a director/day-to-day manager with an extensive background as a real estate agency owner.

Less Inconvenience
Hiring an inside sales agent can be a challenging process, and it is not typically a primary skill for most agency owners. Additionally, it involves locating an appropriate workspace and providing necessary equipment, such as a computer and headset.

In contrast, hiring is our core business, and we possess the necessary expertise. We make the hiring process for a virtual inside sales agent simple for you by performing the recruiting and advertising duties. Furthermore, we set up the workspace with essential equipment, including a computer, two monitors, a headset, and a webcam.

Your responsibility comprises filling out your company profile, specifying your preferred inside sales agent, and responding to any clarifying questions. Subsequently, you should be prepared to interview potential inside sales agents to select the most suitable candidate for your agency.

Better Retention
Because real estate staffing is our core business, we understand how to nurture your inside sales agent so they will stick with the job for a long time. Our inside sales agents work in a modern, comfortable work environment with employees with similar roles at other companies. We also provide them with ongoing education.

Limitations
The only potential downside to hiring a virtual inside sales agent is that you may have to make some adjustments to your processes. You’ll adjust to the task management software and learn to use hybrid work models so you can include them in real estate team meetings. 

ShoreAgents can coach you and your virtual inside sales agent through the adjustment process. In the long run, the workflow will be second nature.

With all the advantages and only one potential disadvantage, a virtual inside sales agent seems to be the answer. The decision is yours. You determine whether the cost savings, specialized skills, ease, and better retention are worth changing a few aspects of your operation. If you’re ready to hire your inside sales agent, we can help you make the relationship work for your team.

Schedule appointments for listing and buyer agents
Entering information into a CRM system to manage and cultivate leads systematically
Establishing and maintaining an organized leads system
Develop new business opportunities
Monitoring sales metrics and performance to meet goals

Inside Sales Agent Role
We’ve compiled a list of the primary duties you might assign to your inside sales agent. We’ve checked those that an inside sales agent could perform virtually. We’ve marked those that require an in-house presence with a cross.

Enter information into a CRM to enable the management of systemized contacts and nurture leads
Develop and ensure an organized system of leads

By its very nature, an inside sales agent job is done mostly inside, which means most tasks can be performed anywhere. ShoreAgents can partner with you to hire the best virtual inside sales agent and invest in the tools for their success.

Where to hire an Inside Sales Agent?
Local hiring is an option. However, recruiting a full-time inside sales agent for real estate requires a considerable amount of time and effort. It takes time away from sales and lead generation work that could improve your bottom line. 

Hiring also is generally not an exciting task for producers who love to be selling homes or negotiate commercial or residential real estate deals. The following is a non-exhaustive list of common obligations and tasks associated with the role of an inside sales agent in the field of real estate.

Construct a precise and comprehensive job description
Ensure compliance with labor laws during the entire process
Publish the job description online and promote the job locally and online
Screen applications to select the most suitable interview candidates
Conduct interviews with applicants
Conduct background checks
Negotiate the salary and discuss the compensation and benefits package for the role
Purchase a computer and locate desk space
Extend a job offer to the preferred candidate

It is important to acknowledge the need to proactively foster engagement for your inside sales agent. Neglecting to do so increases the risk of turnover and the need to repeat the hiring process again.

On the other hand, you could partner with ShoreAgents. ShoreAgents is experienced at filling inside sales agent jobs and keeping these agents engaged. ShoreAgents is an offshore staffing firm based in the Philippines. The Philippines has low labor costs, a well-educated workforce of English-speaking people, a culture similar to European culture, and a BPO infrastructure.

Takeaway
In conclusion, the role of an inside sales agent is critical in generating revenue and driving growth for a company. The duties of an inside sales agent vary from lead generation to customer acquisition and retention. 

The salary of an inside sales agent typically depends on factors such as experience, location, and industry. Companies can hire inside sales agents through various channels such as job boards, social media, or staffing agencies. 

ShoreAgents performs most of the hiring tasks for you. First, we assist you in developing the job description. Then, we leverage our vast network to recruit and advertise the position. We provide you with a list of candidates to interview and allow you to select the best fit for your business.

After recruiting your virtual inside sales agent, we will furnish them with capacious and contemporary office space, a well-equipped workstation, and ongoing real estate education. Moreover, throughout the entire process, we will ensure compliance with all applicable hiring regulations and laws.

Role & Salary Expectations of A Property Coordinator

In today's digital world, businesses are increasingly exploring offshore solutions to streamline operations and expand their talent pool. The real estate industry is no exception, as property management companies seek innovative ways to efficiently manage their properties. In this article, we'll feature the duties and responsibilities of property coordinators and their potential benefits for real estate businesses.

What is a Property Coordinator?
A property coordinator manages property-related tasks and facilitates the rental and sale of properties.

They collaborate with accountants, bookkeepers, the sales team, and the property manager. Their role helps ensure that the properties are fully leased, well-managed, and appreciate in value.

As the title implies, property coordinators are in charge of coordinating properties. They assist property managers by handling leases and maintenance and coordinating financial information related to the property.

They collaborate with team members for rental property sales to prepare and monitor the property's status. They also help in determining whether to acquire new properties.

What is the Salary of a Property Coordinator?
Salaries vary and depend upon several factors. Experience, education, and the duties listed in the job description all play a role in determining a competitive and fair salary.

The primary factor in pay, however, is location. Property coordinators in high-cost-of-living cities earn more than those in low-cost-of-living cities. You can experience significant savings by hiring a virtual property coordinator who lives and works in a low-cost location.

What is the average salary for a Property Coordinator?
The table below is a guide to the annual average property coordinator salary comparison. We featured compensation packages in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Singapore, and the Philippines.

The salary amounts listed in the table for most countries exclude additional costs. For instance, government charges, employer contributions, supplemental insurance, or the cost per employer for equipment. The salaries listed for the Philippines, however, do include employment benefits, government charges, and ShoreAgents’ fees.

Consider hiring a property coordinator in the Philippines, where you can pay much less than in other countries. Despite the lower cost, they can perform the same job diligently and communicate fluently in English. You could hire three virtual property coordinators for the price of one local property coordinator.

Can a Property Coordinator Work Virtually?
Absolutely, as long as you set up your processes, operations, and software tools. You'll take steps to get buy-in from your team for the remote real estate specialist.

ShoreAgents, an offshore staffing firm, specializes in helping companies benefit from hiring virtual property coordinators. We can advise you on the best software tools for optimizing your operations. We’ll also coach you and your coordinator through the process.

The specific tools you’ll need may vary slightly depending on the exact job description. Tools for a virtual property coordinator might include:
A cloud-based task management tool to help you prioritize and manage the daily workload
A clearly defined job description
Clearly written processes and procedures
A team member to drive the property coordinator
Realistic expectations

A property coordinator can function virtually if you make a few alterations. The decision will depend on your business standards. If you like the concept of a virtual property coordinator, ShoreAgents can help make it work for you.

Local Property Coordinator Vs. Virtual Property Coordinator
Hiring a virtual property coordinator has many advantages but only one disadvantage. Before you decide whether to hire a local property coordinator or a virtual one, let’s compare their differences.

Here are the advantages of hiring a virtual property coordinator:

You'll Pay Less
You’ll save money by hiring a virtual property coordinator who is based offshore, such as in the Philippines. Even though you’ll be paying less, you’ll still receive the services of a competent, well-educated property administrator.

You Gain Specialized Skills
Property coordination is a specialized skill within a niche agency. Performing the task effectively requires real estate knowledge and organizational skills. ShoreAgents is uniquely equipped to provide you with an excellent digital real estate manager.

We are the only BPO provider managed daily by an experienced real estate business owner. Therefore, we guarantee to provide you with job candidates who have all the specialized skills you need.

Avoid Complications
Hiring a local coordinator can be quite an undertaking that takes time away from revenue-producing functions. After hiring for the role, you need to find a workspace and equipment before they can begin working.

Compare that to the ease of working with ShoreAgents to hire for this function. We have a six-step process:
Step One: Sign up
Step Two: Complete your company profile
Step Three: Submit a work order describing your ideal candidate for the property coordinator.
Step Four: Talk to us by phone to ensure a comprehensive understanding of your business and your requirements.
Step Five: Interview the candidates we’ve preselected from among the applications and referrals we’ve received.
Step Six: Choose your ideal property coordinator.

We manage advertising and recruitment for you through our extensive network of real estate professionals. We also supply a desk, a computer with two monitors, a webcam, and headphones.

You Are More Likely to Retain Your Staff
Our workplace is modern, well-equipped, and comfortable. Your property coordinator will work alongside other employees that hold similar roles at other companies. They learn best practices from each other. We also provide continuing education to keep them engaged.

Disadvantages
The only downside of hiring a virtual property coordinator is adjusting to a hybrid work culture. The coordinator will be a full member of your team but located off-premises.

You’ll need technology to communicate with them and set their priorities. You also may need to refine some of your processes. However, having well-honed processes and modern technology is not a bad thing. ShoreAgents can coach you and your coordinator through the adjustment process.

The advantages of a virtual property coordinator are significant. However, ultimately, the decision rests in your hands. You decide whether the cost savings, specialized skills, ease, and better retention are worth making a few adjustments. If you’re ready, ShoreAgents can help you make the relationship work for your team.

What are the Duties of a Property Coordinator?
A property coordinator assists in the management, sales, and acquisition of commercial and rental properties. You can decide which specific tasks will be most helpful in your agency.

Here’s a list of typical property coordinator duties and responsibilities:
Process account receivables and assist in collecting rent
Assist in the maintenance of tenant leases
Read and route incoming mail and answer correspondence as directed
File correspondence as needed
Provide a monthly report of leasing transactions and maintenance activities
Assist with due diligence on property acquisition and conveyance
Assist in managing property contracts, surveyors, valuers, and land access
Maintain property records and handle tenant requests

Property coordinators require good organizational and people skills. They also must have skills in operating general office software and the ability to write detailed notes.

They need an understanding of the real estate business. Many property coordinators also have associated degrees in business or real estate-related fields and some prior coordination experience.

Property Coordinator Role
Property coordinators can perform most of their duties remotely. Review the chart below, which indicates the property operations specialist's responsibilities.

Tasks suitable for virtual property coordinators with the right technology are marked with a check. While in-person tasks were marked with a cross. Those tasks that can be largely done virtually, but require some in-person work receive both a check.

Process account receivables and help prepare tenant escalations
Help maintain tenant leases
Handle correspondence
File correspondence as needed
Monthly reporting
Assist with due diligence on property acquisition and conveyance
Help manage property contracts, surveyors, valuers, and land access
Maintain property records
Handle tenant requests

The property coordinator can do most functions remotely with a few adjustments and the right tools. ShoreAgents can help you develop the job description and find the right tools to help your virtual property coordinator succeed.

Where to Hire a Property Coordinator?
You have two primary choices: Choice One is to hire a local employee yourself. Choice Two is to partner with an offshore staffing firm.

Hiring is time-consuming and takes time away from managing and selling properties. You’ll have to do the following recruitment tasks:
Develop, post, and advertise the job description.
Reviewing and assessing applications.
Conducting candidate interviews.
Performing background checks on potential candidates.
Identifying a suitable workspace and acquiring the necessary equipment.
Hiring a suitable candidate.

You’ll need to ensure you complete the process without violating any laws. After you hire the employee, you’ll need to provide continuing education and a stimulating environment to keep them engaged. You’ll also need to constantly evaluate compensation and benefits to ensure they are competitive.

The other option is to partner with ShoreAgents, an offshore staffing solutions firm. ShoreAgents is an experienced hiring partner. We can help you hire the best property coordinator with the following tasks:

Help you develop the job description.
Review applications and provide you with a short list of candidates to interview
Provide a spacious, modern office where the coordinator works with others in similar roles for other companies.
Provide work equipment including a desk, computer, headphones, and a webcam.
Provide constant education.
Ensure compliance with local laws.
Offer our knowledge of the real estate business.

We also have a base location in the Philippines. Outsourcing to the Philippines is a smart option because labor costs are significantly lower than in most Western countries.
The 45 million Filipino workers are highly skilled and well-educated. Filipinos speak fluent English and like working with foreign companies and will adjust their hours to do so. Filipinos are hard workers and their culture is similar to the culture of Brits, Australians, New Zealanders, Americans, and Canadians.

Takeaway
In conclusion, outsourcing a property coordinator to the Philippines proves to be an ideal choice compared to other countries. The Philippines is a prime destination for offshore staffing in the real estate industry. This is because of its lower costs and proficient English-speaking workforce.

Businesses can benefit from outsourcing by harnessing the expertise and dedication of Filipino property coordinators. They can optimize operations, reduce expenses, and achieve successful property management outcomes.

BPO is a significant part of the country’s economy. Partnering with ShoreAgents is the clear hiring solution. We guarantee to meet your staffing standards. Whether you are looking for just one full-time coordinator or a whole team of real estate professionals.

Salaries in many offshore locations are lower than in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Singapore.
If you hire a local assistant, you’ll also need to furnish a desk and other equipment. This includes an ergonomically correct chair, a computer, and a phone or VOIP tool. You’ll also have to find an appropriate office for them to work. 

If you hire a virtual bookkeeper in partnership with ShoreAgents, we’ll provide the necessary facilities and equipment. For instance, this includes a desk, chair, computer with dual monitors, and a webcam.

Specialist Skills

To simplify the hiring process with ShoreAgents, you can sign up and provide your company profile and requirements. Once you submit a work order, a ShoreAgents team member will clarify your needs and requirements for a virtual property bookkeeper.

We will then present a shortlist of candidates for you to interview. This will allow you to choose the best candidate suited for your company. ShoreAgents takes care of all advertising, background checks, and application screening, making the process hassle-free and efficient.

What are the Duties of A Property Bookkeeper?
Property bookkeepers typically assist property accountants in the performance of their duties. The split of responsibilities can vary depending on the property management company and the skills of the workers in each role. Here’s a list of some of the more common tasks in rental property bookkeeping:
Record day-to-day financial transactions
Verify that transactions are recorded in the correct day book or ledger
Bring the books to the trial balance stage
Complete tax forms as instructed by the accountant
Enter data, maintain records, and create reports and financial statements
Process rent payments and pay invoices on the owner’s behalf
Act to recover rent from delinquent tenants
Assist in budget management
Reconcile bank accounts
Gather information for the auditors

Property bookkeepers need general business and accounting software knowledge, experience with maintaining ledgers, and an understanding of general financial principles. They are organized and have impeccable attention to detail. 

They work well as part of a team and have good communication skills. Many have a bachelor’s degree in accounting, business administration, or finance.
The Role of A Property Bookkeeper 
A property bookkeeper can perform all the critical functions of their job remotely with the appropriate software and equipment setup.

We have categorized property bookkeeping duties. We marked those that can be done remotely with a tick and an X for in-person tasks. Tasks that involve a combination of virtual and in-person work are marked with both a tick and a cross.
Recording day-to-day financial transactions
Verifying that transactions are recorded in the correct ledger or book
Managing accounts receivables including collections
Working with the accountant on tax documents
Working with other team members on budget management
Processing rent payments and invoices on the owner’s behalf
Reconcile bank accounts

As you can see, a property bookkeeper can do the job virtually with just a little forethought. ShoreAgents can help you think through your processes so that you can reap the benefits of having a virtual property bookkeeper. 

You can partner with ShoreAgents as we coach to help you find the perfect virtual bookkeeper at the right price.

Where to Hire a Property Bookkeeper?
Your primary choice is to hire locally for this role. However, hiring locally is the most inefficient way to fill the position. Recruiting and hiring a property bookkeeper requires considerable time and effort. 
All the time you spend on hiring is less time looking for other properties to manage. Just think about all the tasks involved in recruiting and hiring a bookkeeper:

Posting the job on job boards and social media and advertising the job locally
Culling through applications, many of which will be irrelevant, to find the most qualified bookkeepers for your company
Interviewing applicants
Conducting background checks
Finding desk space and equipping it
Negotiating and hiring the bookkeeper

If that list seems overwhelming, you’re not alone. Hiring involves a lot of time-consuming details. Also, consider that finding a bookkeeper who also has real estate knowledge might be very difficult.

A better option is to partner with ShoreAgents. 

We handle the recruitment process for property bookkeeper jobs, freeing up your time for other tasks. We provide the following services:
Helping you develop your job description
Recruiting a candidate through advertising and through our vast network
Culling through applications to provide you with candidates to interview

Sharing our knowledge of the real estate business through our founder and day-to-day director, Stephen Atcheler.
Training the bookkeeper in real estate, if they don’t already have real estate experience
A location in the Philippines. Outsourcing to the Philippines is a smart option because
The labor costs are lower in the Philippines. This means that you can hire at least two bookkeepers for the price of one local property bookkeeper.
The country offers a highly skilled and well-educated workforce of more than 45 million people. 
Filipinos speak fluent English and are eager to work with foreign companies.
Filipino culture is similar to European-influenced cultures, such as Britain, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada.

A property accountant is a key position that handles the financial aspects of a real estate company’s rental properties. The major function of a real estate accountant is managing the business side of property management. 

They play an essential role in forming the financial backbone of the property management business and contribute to its success. They are responsible for handling all the financial and technical tasks involved in managing commercial or residential properties.

In addition to this, real property accountant handles all aspects of rental deposit accounting. This involves establishing and overseeing the trust account for rent, tenant deposits, and bonds, including handling deposits and making disbursements.

What is the Salary of a Property Accountant?
The salary for a property accountant depends on several factors. This includes experience, the job’s complexity, and the job’s specific location. The compensation varies by region and city in large countries, such as the United States. You can save a considerable amount of money by hiring a property accountant who will work in a low-cost area.

Working with us is a straightforward process. Begin by signing up and completing your company profile, providing information about your business and needs. Afterward, submit a work order for your virtual property accountant.

Accountants are professionals and remain engaged when they can work with others in similar professions. ShoreAgents provides the opportunity for them to work with other property accountants. We also provide continuing education about the real estate industry. Because we understand real estate human resources issues, we know what’s required to retain employees.

What are the Duties of a Property Accountant?
While property accountant duties may differ across agencies, here are common tasks involved in rental property accounting:
Managing the trust account for rent, deposits, and bonds, and making necessary disbursements to landlords and maintenance staff.
Setting up and maintaining the chart of accounts in your software
Paying salaries and deducting property taxes and other costs as required
Preparing monthly financial reports & balance sheets and providing an analysis of operating expenses
Preparing budgets based on expected rental income and maintenance costs
Ensuring the accuracy of the tenant ledgers and the general ledger
Supervising accounting information and communicating with all internal and external customers about the information
Working with the property owner to ensure compliance with all loan and bond documents.
Producing tax reports
Supervising internal accounting controls and answering any questions or resolving disputes related to them
Managing cash flow issues
Overseeing accounts receivables and acting to collect any delinquencies
Managing the accounting for any fixed assets
Analyzing real estate markets and preparing reports that help owners determine whether to make an additional property purchase as requested
Forecasting performance through short and long-term financial projections
Oversee or assist with the annual company audit

Most property accountants have a college education. At a minimum, they have earned a bachelor’s degree in accounting. They may also have an MBA or some additional business studies beyond the accounting degree. They also know how to use most of the popular accounting and business software tools.

Personal characteristics of good property accountants include excellent organizational skills and the ability to communicate effectively with many different people. A good understanding of the real estate industry is also a necessary job requirement for a property accountant.

The Role of A Property Accountant
Here is a list of the major property accountant duties. We've indicated which tasks can be done virtually (tick) and which require in-person work (cross). If a task has both virtual and in-person components, we've marked it with both a tick and a cross.

Managing the trust account
Setting up the chart of accounts
Managing receivables, including collections
Developing financial and tax reports
Providing analysis to the owner about the potential of buying other properties
Paying salaries and deducting taxes
Providing financial forecasts
Working with other leaders to develop budgets
Working with property owners to ensure compliance

As you can see, a virtual property accountant can definitely do the job virtually. A virtual property accountant can meet the needs of almost every real estate property management business. ShoreAgents can partner with you to find the perfect virtual property accountant at an attractive price.

Where to Hire a Property Accountant?
Basically, the decision of where to hire a property accountant comes down to local vs. virtual using an offshore staffing firm. Hiring a local accountant requires:
Writing a job description based on your own resources
Posting it and advertising the job locally
Culling through applications, many of which will be irrelevant
Interviewing applications
Conducting background checks
Negotiating salary
Buying a computer and finding desk space
Hiring someone

Also, once you find an accountant, they may not have much experience with property management. You’ll have to provide training on that yourself.

As you can see, hiring locally requires a lot of time. Imagine the possibilities if you didn't have to spend extensive time on accountant hiring. You could dedicate more time to communicating with building owners, exploring potential rental properties for sale, and growing your business.

Also, consider that a good accountant is typically in high demand. Don't invest significant time in hiring an accountant only to have them leave for a better job shortly after. Avoid the hassle of finding and setting up a workspace for a new hire.

Now, let’s consider using ShoreAgents, an offshore staffing solutions firm. ShoreAgents is experienced at filling property accountant jobs. 

ShoreAgents can help with job description development, recruitment, and presenting suitable applicants for interviews.

We also fully equip the workspace with a computer, two monitors, a webcam, and headphones. And, we provide training in the real estate business.

Finally, ShoreAgents is located in the Philippines. Outsourcing to the Philippines is a smart option because of the following:
The lower labor costs mean you receive more value for your money.
The country offers a highly skilled workforce of more than 45 million people.
Filipinos speak fluent English and are eager to work with foreign companies.
Filipinos are hard workers and are willing to work at unusual hours to serve clients around the world.
Because of the country’s history, Filipinos share cultural similarities with European-influenced cultures. This includes the UK, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada.
BPO is a large portion of the country’s economy. Therefore, the country has a well-developed BPO infrastructure.

Takeaway
In conclusion, hiring a property accountant can bring significant benefits to a real estate business. A property accountant's role is crucial in managing finances, maintaining accurate records, and offering valuable insights into the property's financial health.

We can meet your hiring and retention needs whether you are looking for one employee or a whole team of employees.

Local Leasing Coordinator Vs. Virtual Leasing Coordinator
Perhaps you’re still weighing the pros and cons of hiring a virtual vs. a local leasing coordinator. Here are some benefits of a virtual leasing coordinator:

You'll Save Money
Hiring offshore is less expensive than hiring locally in most countries. For one thing, wages are significantly lower in offshore locations. For instance, compared to countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, or Singapore.

If the coordinator’s physical base is elsewhere, you avoid the expense of equipping their workspace. Finally, ShoreAgents will take on many time-consuming management tasks, such as employee engagement and ongoing training. You only have to give them a task and manage their daily workload.

You'll Gain Specialized Skills

Coordinating and supporting marketing efforts
Finding and establishing relationships with vendors that offer the best service or goods at the best price
Serving as a point of contact for leasing inquiries

Where to Hire a Leasing Coordinator?
Hiring locally is an option, but probably not the best one for most agencies. Hiring and managing employees aren’t core tasks for property management firms. Your core business is finding more properties to manage and managing them.

Recruiting and hiring require a lot of time. You’ll have to write a job description and then post it on job sites and social media. You’ll have to look at all the applications and resumes, even though most will be from totally unqualified people. You’ll have to schedule and conduct interviews and complete background checks.

Finally, after hiring someone, the process is not yet complete. You will still have to equip their office and consistently find ways to keep them engaged. If the employees are not engaged, they may decide to resign, requiring you to begin the recruitment process anew.

Do you really want to spend all that valuable time hiring a leasing coordinator? Especially a location that will not provide cost-savings benefits comparable to an offshore location?

You have another option — a better option. You can partner with us at ShoreAgents. We are an offshore real estate staffing solutions firm. Recruiting, hiring, and engaging employees make up our core business.

We provide the following services:

More than 45 million people are part of the country’s workforce.
Filipinos speak and write in fluent English.

What are the Duties of a Leasing Assistant?
So, what are the duties and responsibilities of a leasing assistant? Typically, any tasks related to leasing commercial or residential property are expected to be fulfilled by a leasing assistant. They provide the utmost support and assist property managers. This may also vary depending on the company’s needs and the leasing assistant’s skills.

Here is a lease assistant's job description and common tasks:
Provide information to prospective clients about the properties and the leasing process, sometimes showing the property

As you can see, a virtual leasing assistant can do all the core job functions with minor adjustments. ShoreAgents can assist in optimizing your processes and tools to maximize the benefits of hiring a virtual leasing assistant.

Where to hire a Leasing Assistant?
The choices are hiring locally or partnering with an offshore staffing firm to hire a virtual assistant.

Let's consider each alternative. While the local hiring option is a traditional approach, it may not always be the most effective one. In this case, hiring locally would require a significant time investment, which may divert your attention from your core business functions.

Your training as a real estate agency owner likely did not include the skills necessary for managing the hiring process. You are trained to find commercial or residential properties and lease them. You enjoy doing commercial or residential deals. Any time you spend hiring is less time performing your core business function.

Once you hire someone locally, you’ll still have to find and equip a comfortable office space. At the same time, work hard to keep your full-time leasing assistant engaged so they’ll stick with you.

The second option is partnering with ShoreAgents, a real estate staffing firm based in the Philippines. Staffing is our core business and we enjoy seeing how our work helps you succeed. Our hiring services include:
Helping you to clarify what you want in your ideal leasing assistant.
Recruiting and advertising for that assistant.
Presenting you with candidates to interview.
Providing a spacious, modern office where the property accountant works with others in similar roles for other companies.
Equipping the leasing assistant for success with a desk, computer, two monitors, a webcam, and headphones.
Sharing our knowledge of the real estate business through our founder and day-to-day director, Stephen Atcheler.

Takeaway
Our location in the Philippines also provides many benefits in hiring. Filipinos speak and write fluent English and are eager to work with foreign companies. The government provides incentives for specialized training and education, which means the workforce is well-qualified.

The Philippines was ruled first by Spain and later by the United States. Therefore, its culture shares similarities with European countries and with Canada and the United States. Finally, the labor costs in the Philippines are a fraction of those in most Westernized countries.

ShoreAgents is an offshore real estate staffing company that knows what is required to run a profitable property management business. We understand your needs and can help ensure you find the right leasing assistant and develop a productive relationship.

We are ShoreAgents. We provide staff to support every niche within the real estate industry.

Cost-Efficient
Especially if you hire offshore. Offshore virtual assistant property managers from ShoreAgents costs one-third of local hires.

Specialist Skills
Virtual assistant property managers have expert skills as they also work with other virtual assistants. This allows for the exchange of the best property management practices globally and results in fewer complications for the business.

Less Hassle
Hiring is time-consuming. You must advertise the position, cull through applications, and conduct interviews. 

Easy Hiring Process
Working with ShoreAgents to hire a virtual assistant is easy. Here's how the hiring process works:
You sign up with ShoreAgents and fill out a company profile.
You submit a work order for your virtual property management specialist.
One of our team members will reach out to you.
Afterward, we’ll present the pool of qualified candidates that you can choose from.

Better Retention

Limitations

Average Wage and Duties of a Floor Plan Designer

A floor plan designer is crucial in creating functional and well-designed spaces for property development projects. Similar to a draftsperson's role, a floor plan designer specializes in drawing floor plans. Not only does this role work on aesthetically pleasing designs but also makes sure of space optimization.

In this article, we'll present the job description of a floor plan maker. In addition to this, an accurate salary comparison of hiring locally in various countries vs in the Philippines. You will discover the local and offshore options to help you make the best hiring decisions.

What is a Floor Plan Designer?
A floor plan designer works with architects and other engineering team members. They draw floor plans for new constructions or renovation using CAD (computer-aided design) software. Architects and contractors will use these plans, also called blueprints, as a basis for the project.

What is the Salary of a Floor Plan Designer?
When determining a floor plan designer’s salary, you must consider several factors. This includes their experience, education, and certifications. The greater the designer’s experttise, the higher the pay. The designer's location is the primary factor affecting the salary.

This is an essential factor in determining salary because the cost of living varies depending on the country and region. Countries such as Australia and the United States tend to have higher living costs and pay higher salaries. Countries such as the Philippines pay lower wages based on their lower living costs.

In the table, the average salary for a floor plan designer in other countries is significantly higher compared to the Philippines.

The Philippines has significantly lower labor costs than Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Singapore. Hiring a virtual floor plan designer from the Philippines results in significant cost savings for companies in most countries.

ShoreAgents is a real estate staffing solutions firm in the Philippines. We excel in sourcing skilled floor plan designers who work from our modern offices at a fraction of the cost. With our experience, we ensure that you receive well-trained professionals who are committed to serving your company's needs.

Can a Floor Plan Designer Work Virtually?
Because a floor plan designer in the Philippines is so much less expensive than a local one, you’re probably wondering. Can a designer successfully complete their duties remotely?

A designer easily creates their online floor plans in front of a computer, so the answer is yes. However, for many companies, having a virtual employee is a change. As with all changes, you’ll need to do some preparation to ensure the transition goes smoothly.

Specifically, you need to invest in task management software that optimizes the workload. You’ll also have to change your expectations of how you’ll interact with your employee. And, you need to sell your team on the idea that having a professional floor plan designer benefits the company.

ShoreAgents understand the changes you need to make and can help you prepare for a virtual floor plan designer. We have considerable experience advising and coaching companies in managing virtual team members.

The Role of a Floor Plan Designer
Virtual floor plan designers offer a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily drag and drop elements. This includes furniture, doors, and windows onto the floor plan canvas. They furnish and decorate the space by adding furniture and fixtures for visualization.

The designers also provide the option to print to-scale floor plans, ensuring accurate representations of the layout. Users can customize room walls, adjust dimensions, and create floor plans that meet their specific needs. Real estate agents can utilize virtual floor plan designers to showcase properties with interactive and visually appealing layouts to potential buyers.

Consider the pros and cons to determine whether a virtual floor plan creator is the best option for your firm. Here are a few advantages of hiring a virtual floor plan designer:

Ultimate Time Saver
The notion that time is equivalent to money is undoubtedly true. And hiring a floor plan designer on your own in your local market takes a lot of time. By partnering with ShoreAgents, you can utilize that time to generate revenue for your firm.

ShoreAgents takes care of all the time-consuming details that are part of hiring. We handle the recruiting and narrow the pool of applicants to a few finalists. We do the background checks and find and equip a workstation for the new employee. All you have to do is tell us what you need and choose the best option among the finalists we present.

Onboard from a Talent Pool
Being able to design a home floor plan is a highly specialized skill. Some markets will have difficulty finding the right person. ShoreAgents has an excellent reputation in the industry and a vast network of professionals to recruit from. We can find the right floor plan designer for you.

Improve Employee Retention
A major human resource challenge is employee retention. Avoid the inconvenience of hiring someone who may leave your company after just a year. Retention improves when employees have a comfortable and supportive work environment and a job that keeps them engaged.

Floor plan drawing is a specialized skill, and the odds are that your firm will only have one-floor plan designer. The designer can tend to feel isolated in that environment. However, the virtual floor plan designer will work in ShoreAgents’ offices with colleagues doing similar jobs for other companies. They can support each other and eliminate isolation.

We also offer comfortable climate-controlled office space and continuing education so that the designer can keep learning.

Budget-Friendly Solution
ShoreAgents, a Philippines-based real estate staffing solution, offers a much lower cost of living. This is in comparison to New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Singapore, and many other countries. Because the wages are lower, so you’ll save money for your firm. Yet you’ll still receive a highly trained, competent, and hard-working employee.

Disadvantage
The only drawback is that a virtual team member is a new concept and may require adjustments. The good news is that ShoreAgents provides advice and coaching to help you make those adjustments smoothly.

To hire locally or virtually, the decision is up to you. We think the benefits speak for themselves. If you want the benefits that a virtual floor plan designer offers, ShoreAgents can make that happen.

What are the Duties of a Floor Plan Designer?
Floor plan designer duties and responsibilities can vary slightly depending on the firm. Typical tasks that are in a floor plan designer job description include:

Gathering information and structural requirements
Using computer software such as CAD or RIVET to produce 2D drawings and 3D rendering & models
Calculating the limits of materials and providing advice on the building’s structural load or dimensions.
Helping to ensure that the interior designs are practical, accurate, and safe.
Taking accurate measurements at construction sites.
Diagraming workflows and verifying blueprint accuracy. Updating plans as necessary during the construction phase and at other times as required.

In addition to this, a floor plan designer also should possess certain personal characteristics. This includes attention to detail, excellent communication skills, and the ability to work as part of a team. The ability to prioritize deadlines is also critical.

Most floor plan designers have trade college degrees, but some will have four-year degrees in engineering or architecture.

Floor Plan Designer Role
The table below shows the typical responsibilities of a virtual floor plan designer. A check mark signifies remote-performable duties, while a cross denotes duties requiring an in-person team member. 

Gather information and structural requirements.
Produce drawings and models using computer software.
Calculate limitations on materials and provide advice.
Work with the team to ensure safe, practical, and accurate designs.
Take measurements at construction sites.
Produce workflow diagrams, verify plan accuracy, and update plans as necessary.

Most of the floor plan designer’s duties are computer-oriented, so they can do it remotely. An exception is taking measurements at the site. In the case of a virtual floor plan designer, another team member would take the measurements. ShoreAgents can help you adjust your job description and processes so that the virtual designer can succeed.

Where to Hire a Floor Plan Designer?
Hire Locally
You can hire local applicants or contract with a staffing firm, like ShoreAgents. Let’s consider the tasks involved when hiring locally. First, you’ll have to ensure you understand labor and hiring laws in your jurisdiction. Then you’ll have to do certain tasks, including:

Developing a job description and posting it on various websites.
Sorting through applications, many of them from totally unsuitable applicants, to narrow down the field.
Interviewing finalists and choosing the best applicant.
Conducting background checks before making a final job offer.
Finding and equipping a workspace.

Hire through ShoreAgents
At ShoreAgents, we will do most of the tedious hiring tasks for you. We’ll help hone your job description, recruit, and provide you with finalists. We will conduct background checks and provide a fully equipped workstation with essential tools and equipment. 

ShoreAgents can also provide you with concrete advice on growing your firm through the use of virtual assistants. Our director grew his own real estate firm with virtual assistants.

Takeaway
In summary, hiring a floor plan designer brings professional expertise and creativity to property development projects. Floor plan designers optimize space for function, aesthetics, and market value. Their involvement can significantly enhance the overall success and appeal of the property.

Now that you have a brief overview of the costs and other considerations when hiring, the choice is yours to make. You can take advantage of cost savings by hiring offshore and enjoy skipping tedious recruitment tasks.

The Function & Pay of a Residential Engineer
A residential structural engineer is a professional member of the property development team. They design and configure structures, choose building materials, inspect the construction work, and ensure that the residential building is structurally sound.

In this article, we'll discover the common duties of this role and compare the income of hiring locally vs offshore. 

What is a Residential Engineer?
A residential engineer is responsible for ensuring the physical integrity of residential buildings. This role is crucial as they develop detailed engineering designs for subdivision developments. This includes roads, bridges & drainage design, road widening, sewer, and waterworks.

What is the Salary of a Residential Engineer?
Let's discover the hiring costs of a residential structural engineer. Since their duties and responsibilities vary, their salaries will also depend on that. But the primary factor of the salary is location.

For instance, an engineer based in a major city will typically earn more than an engineer in a rural area. The cost difference becomes even more significant when comparing countries. Engineer services in low-cost countries like the Philippines earn less than in higher-cost countries such as Australia.

As seen in the table below, the salary for hiring for this role locally in Australia costs $102,888 AUD. However, hiring offshore in the Philippines only costs $26,429 AUD.

What is the Average Salary for a Residential Engineer?
While salaries vary on several factors, we have established an average salary for a residential engineer in several English-speaking countries. The table below compares the average salaries of residential engineers in different countries and the Philippines.

Local Vs. Virtual Residential Engineer
Hiring a local or virtual residential engineer is a crucial decision for property development projects. Hiring locally allows for in-person collaboration and immediate availability, ensuring face-to-face communication and on-site support. 

On the other hand, opting for a virtual residential engineer has a lot of benefits. This includes access to a wider talent pool, cost savings, and the flexibility of working remotely.

Cost Savings
Suppose you hire a virtual residential engineer who lives in the Philippines. In that case, you’ll save a lot of money over hiring locals in other countries such as Australia or Canada.

ShoreAgents, based in the Philippines, offers cost-effective recruitment and hiring solutions for residential structural engineers. Yet the engineer will be competent and understand the property development business.

ShoreAgents also equips the residential engineer’s workstation, saving you the cost of doing so. We equip our workstations with a desk, computer, monitors, webcam, and headsets.

Time Savings
You’ll also save time by contracting with ShoreAgents to help you hire a residential engineer. Hiring is a drawn-out process, and completing the process will take time away from your core business.

This is where ShoreAgents does most of the work for you. Once you sign up, we help write a stellar job description and recruit from our vast network of real estate professionals. We also conduct background checks. You choose the engineer you like the best among the finalists we present.

Specialized Staffing Solutions
Staffing is our core business at ShoreAgents. As real estate experts, we can assist in finding a highly qualified professional for your residential engineer position.

We also offer a workspace with colleagues in similar positions in our climate-controlled modern office. This collaboration and support also keep the engineer engaged.

While the benefits of hiring a virtual residential engineer are significant, there are challenges with hiring a virtual engineer. You’ll have to be willing to adjust processes and expectations to fit the virtual nature of the job. You’ll need to learn and discover effective task management software.
ShoreAgents can help you adjust your processes and set realistic expectations. We can also help you choose an intuitive task management platform.

Make an Informed Decision
Ultimately, you decide whether a virtual residential structural engineer will work well with your team. Consider the benefits: lower costs, a professional candidate, hiring ease, and an engaged employee. If you want those benefits, ShoreAgents can help you make the necessary adjustments.

Where to Hire a Residential Engineer?

Can a Construction Assistant Work Virtually?
Can a virtual construction assistant effectively handle the job while providing cost savings? The answer is yes, with proper preparation. You’ll need a few things to make the virtual relationship work:
Realistic expectations
A well-written job description
Task-management software and one person to drive the assistant
Team buy-in
ShoreAgents is a real estate staffing solutions firm with experience helping property development companies grow using virtual employees. We can help you make the necessary investments to ensure the success of your virtual construction assistant.

Local Vs. Virtual Construction Assistant
So, you’re considering whether to hire a local or virtual construction assistant. Let us examine the pros:

Ease of hiring
The hiring process can be time-consuming if you hire locally and do all the work yourself. Few property development managers really enjoy hiring, and it’s likely not your best skill either.
At ShoreAgents, staffing is our whole business and we excel at it. We handle the work, freeing up your time for activities you enjoy and excel at.

For example, we’ll help you develop a solid job description, and we’ll do all the recruiting. You interview a small group of finalists we’ve recruited and choose the one that will work best in your office.

Because your virtual assistant will work from our location, we take on the responsibility of finding a workspace for them. We’ll supply a computer, a desk, a chair, two monitors, and a headset. We’ll also provide a modern, climate-controlled work environment.

Specialist Skills
The most effective construction assistants will know about construction and administration. Finding someone with both skills may be challenging. However, we have connections in the property development business and can recruit the best people. We can also provide continuing education in the property development business for your assistant.

Engagement and Retention
Being an administrator can be lonely if the rest of the team consists of engineers, builders, and project managers. Our virtual construction assistants work together in a room with other virtual assistants performing similar functions. 

They support and encourage each other. We also provide continuing education for all virtual assistants. The support and encouragement help to keep your assistant engaged and happy.

Lower Cost
For property development firms in many countries, the most significant advantage of hiring virtually is cost. ShoreAgents is based in the Philippines, which has significantly lower labor costs. 

In comparison to other countries such as the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore. The virtual construction assistants we supply will be well-educated and hard-working. At the same time, they will earn wages that are a fraction of what you will have to pay locally.

Cons
Next, we look at the negatives of hiring a virtual construction assistant. The only downside is the need to adapt your approach to effectively collaborate with a virtual team member. You’ll also need to invest in software to help you manage that team member.

If you're interested in a virtual construction assistant and its benefits, ShoreAgents can assist you. We can help you make the necessary adjustments for a successful partnership.

What are the Duties of a Construction Assistant?
The assistant's job role will vary on the needs of each property development firm. However, you might assign your construction assistant some of the following tasks:

Provide administrative support to other team members such as the construction management staff, finance department, and project manager.
Management and handling incoming phone calls and emails.
Be the point of contact for subcontractors, vendors, and various construction teams.
Provide procurement support and solicit quotes for jobs
Prepare forms and documents, including service agreements, purchase orders, and change orders.
Perform general office duties such as data entry, filing, typing, and ordering office supplies.
Coordinate meeting logistics and outputs
Schedule inspections
Prepare plans and specs for housing and supervise subcontractors. This ensures that they comply with applicable government regulations.
Provide finance department and trade management support.
Maintain an inventory of company materials.
Log any incidences on the construction sites.

An excellent construction assistant will have solid attention to detail and communicate effectively with all stakeholders. They will know basic office software packages and the construction industry. They must be well-organized, have time management skills, and work with a minimum of supervision.

For many construction assistant jobs, suitable applicants will need to be able to read blueprints. Certain companies require construction assistants to hold a 2-4 years college degree in construction management or a related field. Many companies will consider the experience and the right skill set more important than a particular degree.

The Role of a Construction Assistant 
Let's explore the virtual capabilities of construction assistants and determine which duties can be accomplished remotely. Next to each potential task that can be performed virtually, we’ve put a check. 

For tasks that require in-person presence, we've marked them with a cross. Tasks that can be done virtually with some in-person collaboration are marked with both a check and a cross.

Offer administrative assistance to fellow team members.
Supervise incoming phone calls and emails.
Serve as the primary contact person.
Assist in procurement by obtaining quotes for projects.
Prepare various forms and documents.
Execute general office tasks.
Coordinate meeting arrangements and outputs.
Arrange inspections according to the schedule.
Create plans and specifications, ensuring subcontractors adhere to relevant regulations.
Provide support to the finance department and trade management.
Maintain an inventory of company materials.
Record incidents occurring at construction sites.

Administrative jobs easily lend themselves to being performed remotely. A virtual construction assistant can perform most of the typical job duties. In-person assistance is required to assess subcontractor compliance with regulations and communicate any construction site issues.

He knows how to adjust job descriptions and expectations so your business can experience this same growth. He and his team provide advice and coaching to ensure the virtual relationship works for everyone.

Where to Hire a Construction Assistant?
You can hire a full-time construction assistant virtually or locally. Most firms avoid hiring local personnel themselves, considering the significant time investment required.

In addition to this, you need to consider the need to establish a conducive work environment for the hired individual. This includes providing a workstation and enabling opportunities for support and ongoing education.

Chances are that hiring and supporting a construction assistant isn’t really where you want to spend your time.

Particularly if you’ve never had a virtual team member before, you’ll have to consider the following:
Invest in task management software
Set realistic expectations
Find someone to supervise the draftsperson on a daily basis
Work with your team to gain buy-in for the virtual team member

ShoreAgents can help your firm and your team prepare for the virtual draftsperson. We have considerable experience advising and coaching companies in managing virtual team members. We will work with you to ensure the draftsperson’s success.

Local Draftsperson Vs. Virtual Draftsperson
So, you’re probably wondering whether having a virtual draftsperson is a viable option for your property development firm. Let’s take a look at the pros:

Hiring a virtual draftsperson is easy.
Many owners of property development firms don’t enjoy hiring. It’s not as exciting as finding and developing properties. Hiring may also not be your expertise so it can be time-consuming.

Hiring a virtual draftsperson through ShoreAgents is easy and requires very little time. You simply have to do the following:
Sign up with ShoreAgents
Tell us about your company and what you’re looking for
Let us clarify the details 
Interview finalists and choose the best one for your company's needs.
You don’t need to cull through applications or run background checks. We undertake all of those tasks on your behalf. Additionally, you are relieved of the responsibility of locating and furnishing a workstation as we handle all that for you.

You'll find someone with specialized skills.
A draftsperson who knows buildings is a specialist and it can be difficult to find the best one. At ShoreAgents, we help you find capable real estate and property development specialists. We can find the right specialist for your needs.

Your retention will be better.
Our virtual draftspeople work in a modern environment with virtual employees in similar positions. They also have ongoing training. Because they work in an engaging environment and have the opportunity for continuing education, they stay on the job.

You will save money.
ShoreAgents is located in the Philippines, which has a much lower cost of living. This is in comparison to New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Singapore. You’ll be able to hire two to four virtual draftspeople through ShoreAgents for the cost of one local draftsperson. Or, if you don’t need multiple draftspeople, you could use the extra money to hire another virtual team member.

Drawbacks
A virtual team member may be a new concept for your firm. You will need to make a few adjustments to get it to work. But given all the advantages of having a virtual draftsperson, adapting to a new approach will be highly beneficial.

To hire an in-person or virtual staff?

The decision is up to you. When you choose ShoreAgents for hiring a virtual draftsperson, we'll support you to ensure successful relationships. We even provide coaching for you and your draftsperson. 

However, knowing what is required to make it work is all with us. We’ll make sure to transfer that knowledge to you.

What are the Duties of a Draftsperson?
The job duties of a draftsperson can include a wide range of technical drawing activities related to building design and renovations. Some of the more common responsibilities include:

Work with the technical team to gather information and structural requirements.
Use computer software such as CAD or RIVET to produce 2D drawings and 3D models, ensuring production to scale
Calculate materials limitations and advise on issues such as the building’s dimensions or structural load.
Work as part of a broader construction or engineering team. This ensures that the designs for buildings are practical, accurate, and safe.
Survey construction sites and take accurate measurements
Diagram workflows for use in construction projects
Create building schematics and electrical wiring layouts
Produce technical manuals for future maintenance and repair needs
Verify the accuracy of blueprints, plans, and designs.
Update plans during the project’s construction phase
Ensure final designs comply with building regulations
Revise drawings as necessary

A successful draftsperson will have excellent communication skills and work well as a team member. They will have attention to detail and be able to prioritize tasks to meet deadlines. 

Having excellent math skills and experience with specialized computer programs such as CAD, Inventor, and REVIT is also important. At the same time, understanding residential or commercial building codes is also required.

Most draftspeople have trade college degrees, but some will have four-year college degrees in engineering or architecture.

The Role of a Draftsperson 
Below is a list of duties that a draftsperson might typically perform. We’ve marked those that a draftsperson could do virtually with a check. Those that a draftsperson cannot complete virtually are marked with a cross. Those tasks that can be partially completed virtually but require some in-person work need both a check and cross.

Gather information and structural requirements by working with a team.
Use computer software to produce 2D drawings and 3D models.
Calculate limitations on materials and provide advice on building dimensions or structural load.
Ensure that designs for buildings are safe, practical, and accurate, working as part of a team.
Take measurements at construction sites.
Produce workflow diagrams.
Create building schematics and wiring layouts.
Create comprehensive technical manuals.
Ensure the accuracy of plans, designs, drawings, and blueprints.
Update plans during construction.
Ensure designs comply with regulations.
Revise drawings as necessary

Because most of the draftsperson’s duties involve computers, most of the tasks can be accomplished virtually. The only exception is taking measurements at the construction or renovation site. 

Another team member would take these measurements and communicate them to the virtual draftsperson. ShoreAgents can assist you in adapting your processes for the success of the virtual draftsperson.

Where to Hire a Draftsperson?
Fill the Position Locally
Hiring locally is time-consuming and diverts your attention from your firm’s core property development work. However, here are the following steps you need to take for hiring locally:
Develop a job description, delineate the duties and requirements, and provide information about your company.
Post the job description and employment ad on various websites.
Sort through applications to choose a few finalists to interview.
Conduct interviews and choose one applicant.
Conduct background checks before making a final job offer.
Find and equip a workspace for the successful applicant.
Throughout the entire process, you’ll need to be careful to follow all federal and local hiring rules.

Partner with ShoreAgents
The second way to fill a draftsperson job is to hire a virtual draftsperson through ShoreAgents. Hiring a virtual draftsperson through ShoreAgents will save you time and money. It will also improve your retention and provide ready access to a draftsperson who is familiar with the property development business.
ShoreAgents does most of the work for your business including the following:

ShoreAgents recruits using its vast network of real estate and property development professionals. 
Present finalists for your team to interview. 
Conduct background checks when you choose the one that will work best in your setting.
Supply the workstation for your new employee.

Takeaway
In summary, the expertise of a draftsperson requires artistic abilities and technical skills. As we live in the digital era, it's highly recommended to hire virtually. Not only will you be able to achieve cost savings, but you will also gain access to a wider talent pool.

Outsourcing to the Philippines is an excellent way to fill your draftsperson position. The Philippines is one of the most popular BPO sites for the real estate industry. It also makes up a large part of the economy in the Philippines. 

Labor costs are low, yet workers are well-educated and hard-working. They are eager to work with foreign companies and will adjust their hours to your schedule. Your draftsperson will speak English fluently because English is one of the official languages of the Philippines. 

Finally, you no longer have to worry about the cultural difference when outsourcing to this country. The Filipino culture is very similar to Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia. 
If you're looking for a real estate staffing solutions firm to handle your needs, ShoreAgents has your back. Let us help you find the most qualified draftsperson to optimize your real estate business!

The Functions and Wages of a Contract Administrator
Real estate businesses should consider hiring a contract administrator for several reasons. Not only do they help ensure legal compliance, but they also protect the business's interests throughout the contract lifecycle.

In this article, we'll highlight the responsibilities and compensation of a contract administrator. You will also gain expert insights on whether you should hire locally or virtually to achieve cost efficiency. 

What is a Contract Administrator?
A contract administrator is responsible for drafting and managing all sales and purchase contracts. They often negotiate contract terms and oversee vendor contracts and purchase orders. Having a sharp eye for detail is an important skill for contract specialists as they review contractual obligations.

This includes managing contracts (all external and internal), insurance certificates, and purchase agreements. Since this function handles contract-related duties, other team members can focus on core business activities. The expertise of a contract specialist helps real estate businesses to avoid costly mistakes and renegotiations.

What is the Salary of a Contract Administrator?
The salary range for contract administrators depends on several factors. This includes the number and complexity of contracts managed, the level of previous experience, and the size of the firm.

Experienced contract administrators may demand a higher salary compared to entry-level professionals. But most importantly, location is the most significant factor in determining compensation. Wages typically are tied to the cost of living in a city, region, state, or country. 

Contract administrators who live in expensive cities will earn more, while those who live in less costly areas will earn less.

The Philippines has a low cost of living so the wages are relatively low. Property development companies in high-cost countries can achieve significant cost savings by employing virtual contract administrators based in the Philippines.

What is the Average Salary for a Contract Administrator?
We’ve compiled a table that shows the average salary paid to contract administrators in several countries. The table also compares the average contract administrator salary in the Philippines to the average salary in each country.

Note that the salary for other countries does not include extra costs like insurance and government fees. In comparison, the salaries listed in the Philippines already have these costs as well as ShoreAgents’ fees.

You could hire about two Filipino contract administrators for the price of one in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. You can achieve 30 percent cost savings by hiring a Filipino if you are a company based in Singapore.

Can a Contract Administrator Work Virtually?
Yes, a contract administrator can work remotely as long as you’ve paved the way with preparation. For example, you’ll need the following:
Setting realistic expectations
Team buy-in
A well-written contract administrator job description
Task-management software
A manager to supervise the administrator’s day-to-day activities
ShoreAgents can help you with setting your expectations and developing your job description. We can recommend the best task management software and provide counsel on gaining team agreement.

Local Contract Administrator Vs. Virtual Contract Administrator
So, you want to hire a contract administrator and are weighing whether to hire a local or a virtual administrator. Here are the top benefits of hiring a virtual contractor administrator:

Ease of hiring
The hiring process will require a significant amount of your time. You’ll have to develop your job description, post the opening, and then look through applications to find finalists. Once you decide on the best candidate, you’ll need to do background checks.

Furthermore, you will be responsible for managing the entire hiring process in accordance with local laws and regulations. It is likely that hiring is not your preferred use of time either.

At ShoreAgents, staffing is our whole business, and we enjoy it. We do most of the work for you, including recruiting and culling the applications to find the finalists. You choose the best one for your environment.

Specialist Skills
Your ideal hire is an excellent contract administrator who understands the property development business. In many locations, finding someone with both those specialties is difficult. The Philippines has a large workforce, and ShoreAgents knows how to tap into that. We also know how to use our extensive real estate network to find those with property development knowledge.

Engagement and Retention
Being an administrator can be lonely if the rest of the team consists of engineers, builders, and project managers. However, administrators are never lonely in our office. They work alongside colleagues who perform similar functions.

We also offer opportunities for continuing education in real estate. These opportunities also help to keep workers engaged.

Lower Cost
The primary benefit of hiring a virtual contract administrator for property development firms in various countries is cost savings.

Since ShoreAgents is based in the Philippines, it has significantly lower labor costs. This is in comparison to other countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore. In some countries, a Filipino contract administrator can be hired at a fraction of the cost compared to a local administrator.

Cons
Now, here are the challenges of hiring a virtual construction assistant. The only major challenge is that you’re doing something you haven’t done before. You’ll need to adjust your thinking and invest in time management software to help manage your virtual contracts manager.

Therefore, which option would be the most suitable match for your company? A virtual contract administrator who costs less has all the skills and remains engaged. Or the traditional route of hiring a local contract assistant that doesn’t require any new thinking? The decision is yours, but if you decide to go virtual, ShoreAgents will help you meet any challenges you face.

What are the Duties of a Contract Administrator?
The job description for this role will vary depending on the company and the types of contracts it uses. However, contract administrator duties and responsibilities might include the following:

Contract Management: Managing and overseeing the entire lifecycle of contracts. This includes negotiation, drafting to execution, and closure.
Contract Review: Conduct thorough reviews of contracts. This ensures accuracy, adherence to legal requirements, and alignment with business objectives.
Documentation: Maintaining organized and up-to-date contract documentation. This includes contracts, amendments, and related correspondence.
Compliance: Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as internal policies and procedures.
Negotiation Support: Assisting in contract negotiations, providing input on terms and conditions, and identifying potential areas of negotiation.
Risk Assessment: Identifying and evaluating potential risks and legal implications associated with contractual agreements.
Vendor Management: Collaborating with vendors and suppliers to establish and maintain effective working relationships.
Dispute Resolution: Assisting in the resolution of contract disputes and claims and working closely with legal teams or external counsel.
Stakeholder Communication: Assisting effective communication and coordination between internal teams, external parties, and stakeholders involved in contract matters.
 Contract Renewals and Amendments: Tracking contract expiration dates, managing contract renewals and amendments, and ensuring timely updates and adjustments as needed.
Process Improvement: Identifying opportunities for process improvements and implementing best practices. This is to enhance contract administration efficiency and effectiveness.

An effective contract administrator will have exceptional attention to detail and utilize Office software tools. They will have excellent communication skills and work well with other team members.
A positive attitude and proactivity are good personal qualities for a contract administrator. 

Recognition of accounting principles is helpful, as are excellent writing skills. Some companies require that contract administrators have a bachelor’s degree in business and legal knowledge.

Contract Administrator Role
Remote contract administrators can perform most of the typical job duties. The table below demonstrates this. We've listed the common duties and marked those that can be completed entirely virtually with a checkmark.

For tasks that require in-person presence, we have marked them with a cross. Both a checkmark and a cross indicate tasks that require a combination of virtual and in-person work.

Lead contractual negotiations.
Manage, maintain, organize, and be responsible for the contract administration process. 
Ensure insurance certificates related to contracts are collected, reviewed, maintained, and renewed on time.
Ensure achievement of cash flow forecasts and that the project brings in more than it costs.
Create subcontractor and purchase orders. This includes insurance, quality, safety, and environmental documents.
Distribute project documents and request notification of changes.

Complete vendor contracts and purchase orders.
File, scan, and distribute final contracts.
Explain the terms and conditions of contracts to managers and employees and ensure they comply with company contracts.

All the tasks and responsibilities of contract administrator jobs can be performed remotely with the appropriate technology and frame of mind. ShoreAgents is the perfect firm to help you gather the technology you need. 

Stephen Atcheler, who directs the day-to-day operations of ShoreAgents, grew his own real estate agency by hiring virtual assistants. He and his team provide advice and coaching to ensure the virtual relationship works for everyone.

Where to Hire a Contract Administrator?
There are two alternatives to recruiting a contract administrator: hire locally or contract with a remote contract administrator specialist.

Doing the hiring on your own is traditional and it isn’t necessarily the best way. Hiring is time-consuming, and property development is a competitive business. You could better serve your business by focusing on your core business and not spending all your time hiring someone.

Contracting with a company that can provide you with a virtual contract administrator is a less traditional path. This allows you to focus on your core business while leaving the time-consuming work to ShoreAgents. 

Hiring a virtual contract administrator through ShoreAgents is brilliant for business growth in a competitive market. Check out some of the benefits of working with ShoreAgents:

Hiring is easy and less time-consuming. On behalf of your company, we will do all the tedious tasks such as recruiting and conducting background checks.

The large English-speaking and well-educated Filipino workforce is a significant advantage.

Takeaway
There's no denying that a contract specialist's role guides real estate businesses toward efficient and transparent operations. Having considered the cost difference between hiring in the Philippines and other countries, you can now decide accordingly.

In general, Filipinos are hard workers. The business process outsourcing (BPO) industry drives the economy in the Philippines. Workers are willing to adjust their hours for the convenience of foreign companies. In addition to this, the labor costs in the Philippines are significantly lower than in many other countries.

In this article, we'll feature the typical duties, average salary, and expert analysis on hiring a building designer. Continue reading to gain more insights.

What is a Building Designer?
Building designers, also known as architectural designers, are responsible for designing and planning the layouts of buildings and homes. They work closely with architects and create detailed designs, drawings, 3D sketches, and layouts. They also ensure that they meet the specific requirements of each building project and are compliant with local regulations. 

Building designers may supervise team members and collaborate on new construction and various type of projects.

At ShoreAgents, we can assist you in finding the ideal building designer for your project needs.

What is the Salary of a Building Designer?
The salary of a building designer depends upon several factors. Among these factors are the designer’s location, experience, and responsibilities. It is good to note that location is a significant salary factor. 

For example, salaries are typically higher in large urban areas of Westernized countries. While the salary is lower in rural areas or countries with lower costs of living, such as the Philippines.

The table below shows the average salary of a building designer in several countries. In most of the countries listed, the building designer's salary shown is without any additional costs.

ShoreAgents is a real estate staffing solutions firm based in the Philippines. We can help you find the right designer for your design and build a team.
Can a Building Designer Work Virtually?
Yes, a building designer can work virtually, whether they are doing home designs or commercial building designs. To ensure the success of your virtual building design employee, however, you’ll need to make some preparations. 

You should delegate non-virtual tasks to other team members and just your designer's roles. Setting up the technology for virtual meetings is also necessary. 

At the same time, investing in task management tools is important for the designer to manage daily tasks. You’ll also want to get the rest of your design to build the team on board and assign a supervisor.

ShoreAgents can walk you through the steps of preparing for a virtual building design team member. We have considerable expertise in real estate property development and in virtual staffing. We can ensure your virtual building designer has the best chance of success within your operation.

Local Building Designer Vs. Virtual Building Designer
When deciding between an in-person or virtual designer, it's best to consider multiple factors.

How hard is hiring?
You want to find properties to develop, improve them, and make money. Ensuring you have the appropriate team in place is crucial. Nevertheless, it is important to streamline the process of acquiring suitable team members without unnecessary delays. You don’t want to take time away from the rest of your property development business.

Recruiting and hiring the right team member does require a considerable amount of time. You must write a job description and post the job. Then you go through the applications received to find a small group to interview. You conduct the interview and background checks before choosing the right employee.

You can choose to hire a virtual team member through ShoreAgents by simply signing up with us. Inform us of the required roles and we will conduct interviews with pre-screened applicants from our shortlisted pool. You will also get to interview the candidates prior to hiring and select the best one for your team.

How hard is it to find those with the right skills?
Building design is a specialized skill that is necessary for the success of a property development business. Your company may have difficulty finding someone with just the right skills. ShoreAgents, however, is very active in the property development field and can recruit a good designer who also understands the industry.

How do I ensure my building designer is engaged?
Once you have successfully onboarded suitable team members, it is best to retain their services and ensure their continued dedication. Engagement is critical. At ShoreAgents, we provide ongoing training. 

We offer a modern working environment where those in similar property development jobs work together and gain energy from each other. Our system improves employee retention.

How much will the designer cost?
Cost is a significant factor in determining whether you’ll have a virtual building designer or an in-person one. ShoreAgents is located in the Philippines, a country with low labor costs but highly skilled, hard-working people.

A ShoreAgents virtual designer will cost you substantially less than an in-person building designer will cost. Indeed, in many Westernized countries, you could hire three or four building designers for the cost of one in the Philippines. Yet, your designer will still have the same skills and experience.

Disadvantages
The only potential downside to hiring a virtual designer is adapting to a remote work setup. While that involves change and adjustment, you can easily accomplish this. 

Hiring a virtual or in-person building designer depends on what will work best for your company. However, hiring virtually does provide lower costs, easier hiring and retention, and the ability to find highly skilled employees. 

ShoreAgents can provide expert advice and coaching to ensure the relationship works for you and your virtual designer.

What are the Duties of a Building Designer?
The job description of a building designer includes several duties based on your business’s specific requirements. Here are some duties that are typical of building designer jobs.

Discuss the design requirements for new constructions, alterations, or repairs.
Gather the necessary measurements, dimensions, and other routine calculations for design layouts.
Provide suitable design recommendations based on factors such as budget, the building site, and recent trends.
Using CAD software and manual drawing techniques to produce architectural plans for approval. Revision of the designs might also be necessary based on the feedback received.
Research required materials and provide estimates on cost, time, machinery, construction, and other specifications.
Interact with other members of the design team to receive inspiration and provide support.
Record, document, and maintain vital information
Continue to learn and remain up-to-date with the latest design trends.
Ensure all layouts and blueprints comply with industry standards and local codes.

To perform their job correctly, a building designer also needs comprehensive technical knowledge and creativity. Particularly using CAD software.

Many building designers have a college degree in architecture and/or are registered architects. They also have excellent communication skills and the ability to work as part of a team. They also need knowledge of international building codes.

The Role of a Building Designer
Below is a list of duties you might assign to a building designer. Those that a building designer could complete virtually are marked with a check. 

Tasks that cannot be done virtually are marked with a cross. While tasks that have a virtual component but require in-person presence are marked with both a check and a cross.

Discuss the design requirements for new constructions, alterations, or repairs.

Gather the necessary measurements.

Provide design recommendations considering budget constraints, site specifications, and current industry trends.
Produce architectural plans for approval.
Make design revisions based on received feedback.
Research required materials.
Provide cost, time, machinery, and other estimates.

Most of the duties of building design jobs can be completed virtually. A building designer can take measurements virtually for some renovation projects from building blueprints. However, an in-person staff will gather and transfer most of the building measurements to the virtual building designer.

ShoreAgents can help optimize your job description and processes for hiring a virtual building designer.

Where to Hire a Building Designer?
You could hire a local building designer using the traditional process. This includes running an ad, sorting through applications, interviewing the best, running background checks, and hiring someone. This conventional process requires a significant amount of time away from your property development business.

If you hire locally, you’ll also have to find a workstation, ergonomic chair, and computer equipment for your new hire. It is essential to establish a program that fosters engagement and satisfaction among your designer. This ensures their long-term commitment to your company.

Hiring a virtual building designer through ShoreAgents saves you all that time. It also eliminates the need for you to furnish facilities and a workstation. We allocate the workstation, computer, headset, and chair. And, we’ll take care of providing continuing education and an exciting work environment.

Hiring a virtual building designer through ShoreAgents presents several additional advantages, including the following:

Excellent knowledge of the property development business
Advise, coaching, and consultation
A location in the Philippines. Outsourcing to the Philippines is extremely cost-effective. You can hire a building designer at approximately one-third to one-fourth of the cost in the Philippines. This is compared to local hires in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Singapore.

Takeaway
In summary, engaging an outsourced building designer through ShoreAgents offers numerous advantages. This includes cost-effectiveness, access to global talent, and streamlined processes. 

ShoreAgents can assist in designing job descriptions, optimizing workflows, and ensuring the satisfaction and retention of your virtual building designer.

Case Studies, Client Reviews & Success Stories

Client Review by  Jon Beaulieu. Company: BJMP Group, USA. Hired One Agent. Review: "We have hired freelancers in the past however it was unreliable with a lot of inconsistency. We searched Google for other options and came across ShoreAgents in which we are glad we did. The recruitment process was so smooth as they presented us with thoroughly prequalified candidates to interview. We chose our first agent, and we are extremely impressed with her dedication to her work not to mention quality. We will be looking to ShoreAgents for many more roles in the future."

Client Review by  Kuahiwi Kahapea. Company: Ballast Investments, USA. Hired a Workforce. Review: "We've used multiple Outsourcing companies and ShoreAgents has surpassed our expectations by far. From the quality of candidates we receive to the ongoing support, and everything in between. Kath and Mark have made the hiring process a breeze. We're so thankful to work with an amazing team!"

Client Review by  Mark Dwyer. Company: Sales Trainer Active, AU. Hired One Agent.

Hiring a VA has been a game-changer for me in achieving this.

I am truly grateful to ShoreAgents for providing an excellent VA service that I would highly recommend to anyone looking to streamline their business operations."

Client Review by  Marinella Sortino. Company: Barry Plant Gladstone Park, AU. Hired a Team. Review: "The team at ShoreAgents have been able to provide us with two wonderful staff. We were recommended to reach out by another happy client and they did not disappoint. Mark and the team made the process seamless and very professional. As we could not decide on which applicant to onboard so we took both and created another role. We are so grateful as both are beautiful and hardworking members of our team that have become proficient in their respective roles. We highly recommend ShoreAgents to any prospective employer looking to use the service to provide quality applicants."
