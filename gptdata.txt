How it Works
How Our Recruitment Works
You submit a job description of what you are looking for.
The job description you create should include all duties for your new team member to perform in a bulleted list. Ideally, your tasks will not be too difficult and may be repetitive.
We start the search
Our candidate searches are conducted using at least 10 sources that include job sites, job advertisements, social media, referrals, and our own database of more than 25,000 potential candidates.
We filter and test worker candidates
Our high-tech filtering methods select candidates for you that we feel are most suitable for your role. We then can qualify these candidates using typing, English and aptitude tests that we’ve developed.
You interview qualifying candidates and select the one you like best.
Out of the pool of endorsed candidates that we present to you, you’re free to interview any or all of them to select the new team member you like best.
We onboard and they start working for you
Once you’ve selected the winning candidate, we’ll formalize their job offer and onboard them, and they’ll start working for you. We’ll be thoroughly involved in their first days of working for you, and our staff will be ready to address any obstacles or difficulties that they or you may encounter from those days going forward.

How Does Staff Management Work?
Be ready for day 1

ShoreAgents makes sure that team members communicate with clients as openly, honestly and often as possible to allow work to be executed efficiently, punctually and industriously.

What Standard Support Services Do We Provide?
Equipment
We provide a complete PC equipped with dual monitors, a webcam and a communications headset for all team members.
Management
Our staff functions as onsite managers, making sure the work gets done every hour, day and week. We make sure all issues, eventualities and emergencies are handled and dealt with as quickly and professionally as possible.
Performance
Our staff and support infrastructure measures worker performance so that goals can be reached and workers can be rewarded for extra effort.
HR and Legals
ShoreAgents handles all Human Resources support for your remote workers via a web-accessible HR hub, including panels for logged hours, employment contracts, leave requests, worker tardiness, etc. ShoreAgents also handles all legal aspects of worker employment.
Payroll
ShoreAgents takes care of payroll for your remote team members, including accounting for benefits and local charges, overtime/undertime, etc. All team members are given a standard bank debit card, so they can be paid. You’ll receive one simple invoice from ShoreAgents, and we’ll handle everything else.
IT Support
We have a full IT division that monitors and updates all hardware, software and network services.
Staff Engagement
We make sure your remote team members are kept happy and engaged, by celebrating work anniversaries and birthdays, providing activity clubs and monthly games, supplying free coffee and subsidized food and giving out monthly awards like employee of the month plus more.

We maintain high-speed Internet over multiple connections for all team members in our office.

Staff and Client Coaching

Our staff can advise you and your organization about how to best leverage and integrate remote workers, given your business objectives and targets.

What Do You Need To Do To Use Our Services?
Task Allocation
The most important priority is for you to select tasks for your remote workers to perform. These tasks should be clearly defined and preferably not too complex (being repetitive is OK!).
Staff Training
You should determine who in your organization will train your remote team members. Ideally, they will have a deep understanding of what they will be training new team members on and may have trained other staff previously.
Manage KPI's
To get a good idea of how well your remote workers are performing, it’s recommended that you develop and observe key performance indicators (KPIs) you can use to measure success.

We Help Businesses of All Sizes Grow While Reducing Costs. What Does Your Business Need?
One Agent
Businesses that are small or new to outsourcing may want to start with just one agent. Getting comfortable with one agent will set you on the path to growth and potentially hiring additional team members further down the road.
Teams
Businesses that are growing and/or those that have some experience with one remote team member can add additional workers to build a team. Teams can support just one line of business, or several.
Workforce
Larger businesses and/or those that wish to deploy teams across multiple lines of business can build fully remote workforces using ShoreAgents.

Rules of Engagement
We can find you one, some but you can't have none.
We like our clients to be borderline obsessive-compulsive and be highly focused on growth.
It is a must that our clients have a sense of humor, as some mistakes are inevitable along the outsourcing journey — but these are always opportunities for learning.

How Does it Work?
If you’d like to conduct a talent search with us, it’s really simple:
Fill out the Get Started Form
Submit your Job Description
Zoom Call with our team
Our support team will reach out to schedule a quick chat regarding the role you want to hire for.

The reason we do this is that every business is unique, and you’re the one who knows your business best. We’ve been at this long enough to know that a uniform approach doesn’t work for all firms; instead, we want to be 100 percent in-tune with what your needs are, so we can calibrate your expectations for success.

We organize our candidates into four well-defined groups, which are categorized as follows:
Exact Matches
An exact match is a candidate possessing all of the skills you’re looking for, who also has relevant experience and who is even familiar with many of your digital/online tools. These candidates are extremely rare to come across, but when we find them, we take the utmost measures to secure them for you. Keep in mind that candidates with the exact skills you need will typically be in high demand, so their cost will invariably be higher than average.
Transferable Skills
These candidates may not have worked in the exact industry niche your organization lies within, but they possess skills that are transferable. Most tasks that businesses have for remote workers tend to be fairly easy to perform and very teachable. These job candidates are quick learners and will typically get up to speed quickly, as they have previous experience in similar roles. Their cost will be slightly less than that of Exact Matches.
Entry Level
These candidates aren’t new to the workforce, but by the same token, they don’t come with a lot of experience. They’re minimally qualified for most tasks and will require some training to get up to a level where they’ll be useful for your team. Because they’re still getting their feet wet in terms of work experience, their skills and cost will be somewhere between candidates with Transferable Skills and Fresh Graduates.
Fresh Graduates
These candidates are absolutely new to the workforce. In most cases, they’re new university graduates who are extremely hungry to start working and learning. They tend to adapt to new jobs like ducks to water. We’ve had amazing success in placing these candidates, and their rise through the ranks to advanced positions continues to astonish us. The return on investment for firms that believe in these candidates is typically phenomenal. Even better, the cost of a fresh-graduate team member may be roughly half that of an Exact Match.

How Do We Attract Candidates?
We’re plugged into multiple job networks that allow us to select candidates from a diverse array of talented workers. We put more resources into locating worker candidates than we do into the marketing of our firm; after all, our business rests on your success, which, in turn, is enabled by our company delivering the most talented workers we can find.

We locate top talent via:
Our Database of 25,000+ Candidates
Facebook Ads
SMS Alerts
Our Own Referral System
LinkedIn Ads
Active Search
Job Sites
Google Ads
Jobs360
Facebook Groups
Electronic Direct Mail (EDM)
Between all of these sources, we attract more than 1,000 candidates per month. But out of this total, we only accept the top 5 percent of applicants. When we receive a new candidate’s application, we take care of all of the heavy lifting, so you don’t have to.

First, we verify all aspects of a candidate’s resumé to make sure they’re suitable for roles at our company.

Second, we conduct a phone screening with a candidate and allow them to evaluate themselves. We then assess them and grade them on:
Spoken English
Written English
Attitude
Qualifications
Goals
Job Knowledge
Computer Skills
Work History
Typing Speed

If we’re satisfied with these assessments, we’ll invite the candidate to a first-round interview conducted by our success team. We treat this as a formal interview, as it will be presented to you, the client. To save time, we ask many of the normal interview questions you might ask the candidate if you were conducting the interview yourself. Some of these questions will include:
What are your key strengths?
For cases where the client has very few or no tasks to assign to you, how will you handle this scenario?
What steps would you take if you didn’t completely understand a task?
Certain technical issues may arise while you’re working. How will you handle these?
How would you handle cases where the client is not easy to deal with or difficult to communicate with?
How long are you planning to stay with our company if you’re hired?

We welcome your testing of suitable candidates using any tools or methods you prefer. If you don’t have testing tools or methods for candidate evaluation, we’ve developed several of our own.

Our optional secondary filtration methods include the following tests:
Typing Test: Because a client’s tools are digital and online, a fast typing ability is crucial for worker candidates to possess. We can administer a typing test that measures both speed and accuracy.
English Testing: Our English test measures English-language speaking, reading and writing abilities. As English is the common denominator for all our clients, it’s critical that our workers be able to use it properly and be able to parse it accurately, whether it’s written or spoken.
Aptitude Testing: Our aptitude test was developed from more than 30 years’ worth of combined business experience, using business owners’ perspectives. This test allows clients to save time and see in advance how a worker candidate thinks and responds, and where their work ethic lies.

When these tests are administered, for quality purposes, every candidate is manually graded. Based on all the information we’ve gathered and the grading and assessments we’ve made, we endorse candidates we believe would be best suited for your position.

We present all endorsed candidates to you, along with their video introductions and interviews that we’ve already conducted with them. It’s up to you which candidates you would like to select for interviews with your company.

We’ll set up interviews for you with all your chosen candidates. We’ll assist you with these interviews, so we can listen in, help you with your final selection and give you feedback on your decision. But rest assured that the final selection is ultimately yours and yours alone.

Once you’ve made a choice, we’ll send a job offer with the agreed-upon salary to the candidate. Once the candidate accepts the offer, we’ll begin the onboarding process for the specified starting date. We’ll make sure all infrastructure and support programs are ready for the new team member’s first day, and at that point, our staff management takes over handling them.

Chapter 1: The Unique Approach to Recruiting a One-Agent Staff Member for Real Estate Businesses

Recruiting the right virtual staff member for your real estate business requires a unique approach, especially when it comes to hiring a one-agent staff member. At ShoreAgents, we specialize in providing remote staffing solutions to real estate businesses worldwide. In this chapter, we'll guide you through the recruitment process for hiring a one-agent staff member and help you find the right candidate from our pool of 25,000+ real estate-focused candidates.

Creating a Detailed Job Role: The Key to Successful Recruitment of One Agent Staff Members
The first step in recruiting a one-agent staff member is creating a detailed job role. This can be challenging, especially if you're new to the process. However, with the help of tools like Chatgpt, you can make it easier by recording all the necessary tasks and putting them into a formalized job role. When creating a job role, it's essential to document all the tasks your virtual staff member can complete offshore. These are typically tasks that are completed online or over the phone. It's also important to itemize the tasks in a way that's easy to understand and learn for your new staff member.

Understanding the Importance of Detailed Task Documentation and Training Materials for One Agent Recruitment.
As a smaller business, you may have many tasks that could be completed, and the roles could be more diverse. This means that you need to have a larger scope of knowledge across the whole business. Therefore, it's crucial to mark down the difficulty of each task, whether it's easy, medium, or hard, and whether you have any official process for it. When working with a staff member in the Philippines, you need to have training material, process material, and procedures for each of the tasks that they're going to be completing. So it's best to have all these things ready before you even start the recruitment process.

Finding the Right Candidate: Navigating ShoreAgents' Screening and Interview Process
Once you have the job role and tasks documented, it's time to create a work order and look for the right candidate. At ShoreAgents, we are always hiring for similar jobs and have a large database of 25,000+ candidates. There may already be someone suitable for your job in our pool. However, we also advertise across multiple platforms to ensure we attract the right candidate. Once we attract candidates, we filter and test all of them for you. We run them through some basic screening, and if they pass and we think they'll be suitable for your job role, we'll offer them a company interview.

The Unique Company Interview Process for Hiring One Agent Staff Members at ShoreAgents
Our company interview process is unique and saves you time. It's conducted by our success team, and we record it for you to review. This way, you can quickly see who you want to formally interview. It's especially useful when hiring someone for an on-the-phone role, as you'll hear how they speak and communicate. We then endorse a group of candidates to you who we think are suitable for the role, and you make your decision of who to interview.

Finalizing the Hiring Process for Your One Agent Virtual Staff Member
Once you've conducted the interviews and selected the right candidate, our team will reach out to them and book a zoom call with you, the candidate, and whoever needs to be on the call from your business. This call is your opportunity to ask any questions you need to ensure they're a good fit for your company. Once you've made your decision, we offer the candidate the job, and once they accept, they'll start working for you.

The Key to Successful Recruitment: Finding the Right Fit for Your Real Estate Business with ShoreAgents.
In conclusion, recruiting a one-agent staff member requires a unique approach that focuses on finding the right fit for your real estate business. Creating a detailed job role, documenting all necessary tasks, and using our unique company interview process are the keys to successful recruitment. With the help of ShoreAgents, you can easily find the right candidate for your one-agent staff member role and ensure they'll fit seamlessly into your business.

Chapter 2: Training and Onboarding: Things to Consider After Accepting Your New One Agent Staff Member
Preparing for Your One Agent Staff Member's Start Date: Software and Communication Tools
Congratulations on selecting your new one-agent staff member! Now that you have accepted the candidate and signed the job offer, it's essential to prepare for their start date to ensure a smooth onboarding experience.

One of the most critical things to consider is the software and communication tools the staff member will be using within your business. It's important to make sure you have all the necessary logins and access prepared, and we recommend creating a company email for the staff member to use for all communications and logins.

Establishing Efficient Task Management Processes for Your One Agent Staff Member

Another consideration is how tasks will move from your internal team to your external one agent staff member. Do you have any productivity software in place to manage and delegate tasks? It's crucial to establish clear processes for task management to ensure efficiency and accountability.

Creating a Training Plan for Your New One Agent Staff Member: A Key Element for Successful Onboarding
Additionally, it's important to have a training plan in place for your new staff member. This includes providing them with all necessary training materials, scheduling training sessions, and assigning a point of contact for them to ask questions and receive support during their onboarding process.

Establishing Clear Communication Channels and Expectations with Your New One Agent Staff Member

Finally, make sure to establish clear communication channels and expectations with your new staff member. Will you be having regular check-ins or team meetings? How often will you be communicating with them? These are all crucial elements to consider when onboarding a new one agent staff member to ensure their success in your business.

Chapter 3: Communication and Productivity Tools for Success

When it comes to managing a one-agent staff member, communication and productivity tools are crucial for success. In this chapter, we will dive deeper into the importance of these tools and how they can benefit your business.

Enhancing Productivity with Task Management Software for Virtual Teams

Productivity software such as Clickup, Asana, Basecamp, Airtable, and Trello are specifically designed to help manage and delegate tasks efficiently. These tools make it easy to track progress, assign tasks, and communicate with your staff member. With numerous options available, it's important to research and find a tool that works best for your business needs.

The good thing about productivity software is that they are designed for remote work and make life very easy. They allow you to easily pass tasks between your team and your virtual staff member. Whether you use Google, Outlook, or Teams, the system should be easy to use and accessible to all team members involved in the project.

Effective Communication Platforms for Managing a Virtual Staff Member
Clear communication channels are critical when managing a virtual staff member. Establishing an efficient communication platform that allows you to communicate effectively is important. Popular options include WhatsApp, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet. It's important to select a platform that works best for your business and meets your specific communication needs.

The communication platform you choose will also play a crucial role in conducting training and communicating with your staff member. If your staff member will be on the telephone, you need to have a VoIP system set up. This will enable them to communicate effectively with other members of your team and customers.

Benefits of Productivity and Communication Tools in Virtual Staff Management
The advantages of productivity and communication tools are numerous. They make it easy to collaborate with your virtual staff member, share files, track progress, and delegate tasks. Additionally, they allow you to communicate with your staff member in real-time, making it easy to ask questions and provide feedback.

Maximizing Efficiency: Strategies for Effective Use of Productivity and Communication Tools
Using Productivity and Communication Tools Effectively
To use these tools effectively, it's important to establish clear processes for task management and communication. Set clear expectations for the use of the tools and provide training to your staff member. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page and knows how to use the tools effectively.

The Importance of Productivity and Communication Tools in Managing a One Agent Staff Member
In conclusion, productivity and communication tools are essential for the successful management of a one agent staff member. By selecting the right tools and establishing clear processes, you can ensure a seamless workflow and effective collaboration with your virtual staff member.

Chapter 4: Creating a Training Plan and Documenting Procedures for Virtual Staff Members
Once you have selected your virtual staff member, established clear communication channels, and implemented productivity tools, the next step is to create a training plan and document procedures.

Chapter 5: How We Together Manage Your One Agent Team Member
Once you've selected your one agent team member and established a clear communication channel with them, the next step is to manage them effectively. Managing a remote worker can be challenging, especially when they are located on the other side of the world. This is where ShoreAgents comes in with a three-tiered approach to managing your remote team member's performance and relationship with your organization.

Maximizing Performance with Performance Reviews for Your Remote Staff
ShoreAgents believes that no one is better suited to comment on your staff member's performance than you. As their direct manager, you'll be the one administering the work and conducting training daily. We rely on you to take responsibility for these tasks. To provide critical feedback, we'll reach out to you in interviews held during the first, third, and fifth months following your hire(s) and annually thereafter.

During these reviews, we'll obtain feedback related to your staff member's quality of work, desire to improve, job knowledge, communication, teamwork, time management, reliability, and overall attendance. We'll assess the feedback received for each team member individually and take necessary actions, including meeting with you and the team member if needed, to help you avoid any negative consequences for your business. If appropriate, we can implement training plans to help your staff improve and explore new areas.

Catch-Ups for Effective Remote Staff Management
Catch-ups with your remote workers are undertaken monthly by our success team to obtain feedback about how they're handling working with you and your internal staff. We'll shoulder this responsibility, as there may be information they're more comfortable sharing privately with us. We'll use this information to help your staff improve in areas they may be struggling with or are eager to learn more about. Once we receive this worker feedback, we'll conduct a one-on-one session with each team member to discuss the results in detail.

The Importance of Check-Ins in Managing Remote Staff Members
During the early days of your staff member's engagement, we'll check-in weekly to ensure they're fitting into their roles and the office environment. A successful start is essential for every new team member, and check-ins help us identify critical areas where additional workers can offer the most assistance and value. With every check-in, our success team will assess the ongoing work and worker performance levels and provide feedback to you and your team. These check-ins will be conducted regularly every week until you feel they're no longer needed and/or your team member is settled in and performing to the best of their ability.


Managing Remote Workers Made Easy with ShoreAgents' Three-Tiered Approach
Managing a remote worker can be a daunting task, but with the help of ShoreAgents, we can ensure that your staff member is performing to their best ability. Our three-tiered approach to staff management is essential for your remote working success.

Chapter 1: Introduction
So you want to build a team with ShoreAgents? Congratulations on taking this significant step towards optimizing your business operations! We're excited to potentially have you on board. As a leading outsourcing provider, we understand the unique requirements and challenges of assembling and managing a remote team, and we're here to help you every step of the way.

Building a team versus hiring one agent can indeed be a different experience, but with the right guidance and support, it can be a rewarding and transformative decision for your business. A well-built team can help you scale your operations, increase efficiency, and maintain a high level of quality across various tasks and projects.

In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the entire process of building a remote team with ShoreAgents. We'll delve into crucial topics such as recruitment and how to find the best talent, onboarding and training to ensure a smooth start for your team members, account management and ongoing support to facilitate a productive work environment, and overcoming the challenges related to managing a remote team, including cultural differences and communication barriers.

By the end of this guide, you will have a solid understanding of the process, benefits, and best practices for building and managing a remote team with ShoreAgents. Whether you're new to outsourcing or looking to expand your existing remote workforce, this guide will provide you with valuable insights and practical advice to help you make the most of your investment in remote team building.

Chapter 2: Building a Team vs. Hiring One Agent
In this chapter, we will explore the differences between building a team and hiring a single agent, as well as the advantages and challenges of each approach. Understanding these differences will help you make informed decisions about how to structure your remote workforce and ensure the best possible outcomes for your business.

Building a team can indeed present its challenges, such as coordinating multiple people, ensuring effective communication, and managing potential conflicts. However, when set up correctly, a well-structured team can become a more efficient and powerful asset for your business.

The team approach is generally more suitable for mid-sized businesses that can benefit from having more specialized roles, allowing each team member to focus on their specific area of expertise. This results in a more efficient division of labor and higher overall performance, as opposed to having one person juggling multiple tasks with varying levels of proficiency.

When building a team, you will need to consider the following factors:
Define clear roles and responsibilities: Ensure that each team member has a well-defined role and a clear understanding of their responsibilities. This will help avoid confusion, duplication of efforts, and potential conflicts among team members.
Establish a strong team leader: Appoint a capable team leader who can act as the primary point of contact, manage the team's performance, and facilitate communication between the team and the rest of the organization.
Implement effective communication and collaboration tools: Choose the right tools and platforms that enable seamless communication and collaboration among team members, such as project management software, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools.
Create a supportive work environment: Foster a positive and inclusive work culture that encourages teamwork, open communication, and mutual respect. This will help create a strong sense of belonging and loyalty among team members, which is essential for a successful remote team.
On the other hand, hiring a single agent can be a more straightforward process, especially for small businesses or those just starting with outsourcing. While a single agent may be able to handle multiple tasks, their effectiveness may be limited by their skill set and capacity, potentially affecting the quality and efficiency of their work.

In conclusion, the decision to build a team or hire a single agent depends on the size and needs of your business, as well as your long-term goals and vision. By carefully considering these factors and following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can build a remote workforce that drives your business forward and contributes to its success.

Chapter 6: Identifying and Developing a Team Leader
Selecting the right team leader is essential for fostering a cohesive, high-performing remote team. In this chapter, we'll discuss the importance of identifying and developing a team leader, as well as the qualities to look for and how to empower them to effectively manage your team.
Importance of a Team Leader: A team leader serves as the bridge between you and your remote team. They are responsible for coordinating team activities, overseeing daily operations, and ensuring that everyone is working towards a common goal. A strong team leader can alleviate much of the stress associated with managing multiple team members, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your business.
Qualities to Look For: When identifying a potential team leader, consider their communication skills, problem-solving abilities, adaptability, and capacity to motivate and inspire their team members. The ideal candidate should possess a strong work ethic, be proactive, and have a solid understanding of your business and its objectives.
Promoting from Within: It's crucial to promote a team leader from within your existing team, rather than bringing in someone from the outside. This approach ensures that the chosen individual has a deep understanding of the team's dynamics, work processes, and company culture. Promoting from within also demonstrates your commitment to recognizing and rewarding hard work and dedication, leading to increased morale and loyalty among your team members.
Providing Support and Training: Once you've identified a team leader, it's essential to provide them with the necessary support and training to succeed in their new role. This may include leadership training, ongoing mentorship, and access to resources that will help them develop their skills and manage the team effectively.
Empowering Your Team Leader: Empower your team leader by granting them the autonomy to make decisions and manage the team's daily operations. Trusting them to handle these responsibilities will not only boost their confidence but also improve their ability to lead the team effectively.
Regular Check-ins and Feedback: Maintain an open line of communication with your team leader, conducting regular check-ins to discuss their progress and address any concerns they may have. Provide constructive feedback and guidance to help them grow in their role and continue to enhance their leadership abilities.
In summary, identifying and developing a team leader is a critical aspect of building a successful remote team. By selecting a capable and committed individual, providing them with the necessary support and training, and empowering them to lead, you can create a strong foundation for your team's growth and long-term success.

Working with a remote team often means dealing with cultural differences that can impact communication, work style, and overall team dynamics. In this chapter, we'll explore some common cultural challenges you may encounter and provide guidance on how to overcome them with the help of our success team.
Communication Styles: Different cultures may have unique ways of expressing themselves, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. It's essential to establish clear communication channels and promote open dialogue to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Encourage your team members to ask questions and share their thoughts, and be mindful of potential language barriers or nuances in communication.
Work Ethic and Time Management: Different cultures may have varying expectations regarding work hours, punctuality, and work-life balance. Establishing clear expectations from the outset can help mitigate any potential issues. Be flexible when possible and strive to create a work environment that respects and accommodates the diverse needs of your team members.
Decision-Making and Problem-Solving: Cultural differences can also influence decision-making and problem-solving approaches. Ensure that your team members understand the expectations surrounding these processes and provide guidance as needed. Encourage collaboration and the sharing of ideas, fostering an environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing their perspective.
Building Trust and Rapport: Establishing trust and rapport among team members with diverse cultural backgrounds can take time and effort. Organize team-building activities and promote open communication to help bridge cultural gaps and foster a strong sense of camaraderie.

Chapter 9: Ensuring Redundancy and Scalability
In this chapter, we will discuss the importance of redundancy and scalability when building a team with ShoreAgents, as well as strategies to achieve them. Having a well-structured team ensures that your business remains operational and can grow seamlessly, even if one team member is unavailable or if your workload increases.
Cross-training and Skill Development: To ensure redundancy, it's crucial to cross-train team members in multiple tasks and responsibilities. This enables them to cover for each other during absences or emergencies. Encourage skill development and knowledge sharing among team members to create a versatile workforce capable of stepping in whenever needed.
Documentation and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Developing comprehensive documentation and SOPs for your team's tasks and processes is vital. This ensures that any team member can quickly understand and execute tasks, even if they are not their primary responsibility. Regularly update these documents to keep them relevant and useful.
Backup Plans and Contingency Strategies: Establish backup plans and contingency strategies for critical tasks and roles. For example, designate backup team leaders or key personnel who can step in during emergencies or absences. This will help maintain continuity and reduce the impact of unforeseen events on your business operations.
Scalable Team Structure: Design your team structure to be scalable, allowing you to add or reassign team members as your business grows or your needs change. This might involve creating specialized sub-teams or implementing a flexible organizational hierarchy that can be easily adjusted.
Regular Performance Reviews and Team Assessments: Conduct regular performance reviews and team assessments to identify areas for improvement and potential bottlenecks. By addressing these issues proactively, you can ensure that your team remains agile and can adapt to changing circumstances.
Effective Communication and Collaboration: Foster a culture of open communication and collaboration within your team. This will encourage team members to support each other and share their knowledge and expertise, contributing to redundancy and scalability.
Leveraging Technology: Utilize productivity and communication tools to streamline workflows and enhance collaboration. These tools can help your team stay organized and connected, allowing for seamless coordination and the ability to scale up or down as needed.

Chapter 1: Understanding Workforce with ShoreAgents
At ShoreAgents, we define a workforce as a group of staff members numbering six or more. Our specific service guide is designed to meet the unique requirements that come with building a larger workforce, as opposed to forming a smaller team or hiring a single agent. This guide will help you understand how to effectively structure and manage your workforce with us.

The first step towards building a workforce with ShoreAgents is a clear understanding of your internal team structure. This is crucial because when establishing a workforce in the Philippines, different teams or groups of team members are required to specialize in various sectors. Let's consider an example.

Suppose you run a property development business, and you plan to outsource certain operations, like your finance department, contract administration, property marketing, and general back-office tasks. In that case, you would require distinct teams for each area. This could mean needing three contract administrators, five staff members for your finance department, five for basic admin support, six for property marketing, and perhaps a few drafters.

It's crucial that you identify team leaders within your organization who will be responsible for managing these divisions in the Philippines. They will serve as your primary points of contact and will be responsible for maintaining smooth operations.

Remember, building a workforce isn't just about hiring a group of people to complete tasks. It's about creating a well-structured, efficient, and collaborative system that ensures your business runs smoothly. By taking the time to understand what a workforce really means and how it applies to your business, you're already on your way to building a successful team with ShoreAgents.

In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into how you can evaluate your current team structure and how to adapt it for your workforce in the Philippines. Continue reading to learn more!

Chapter 2: Evaluating Your Team Structure
Once you have a solid understanding of what building a workforce with ShoreAgents entails, the next step is to evaluate your internal team structure. This is a crucial process that will shape your offshore team and determine its efficiency and effectiveness.

The goal is to create a structure that complements your existing operations and maximizes the capabilities of your offshore team. This involves understanding the roles you need to fill, the number of individuals required for each role, and who will manage each team.

If you operate a property development business and plan to outsource various functions, for example, you need to determine how many individuals you require in each department. This could be three contract administrators, five in finance, five in basic administration, six in property marketing, and perhaps a few drafters. This assessment helps you understand the scale of your offshore team.

Next, identify team leaders within your organization who will oversee these divisions in the Philippines. These leaders should be capable of managing the team, understanding their needs, and ensuring their performance aligns with your company's goals. These team leaders will act as the bridge between your local and offshore teams, ensuring a seamless flow of communication and effective coordination.

It's crucial to remember that your offshore team's structure should mirror your organization's culture and values. Ensure that the roles, responsibilities, and hierarchy align with your business ethos and are designed to promote collaboration and productivity.

Evaluating your internal team structure is not a one-time process but should be an ongoing activity. As your business grows and evolves, your team structure should also adapt to accommodate new roles, increased workload, and operational changes.

In the next chapter, we will delve deeper into how to structure your offshore team in the Philippines, focusing on how to choose leaders and foster growth. 

Chapter 3: Structuring Your Offshore Team
After evaluating your team structure, the next step is to form the structure of your offshore team in the Philippines. Here, you need to designate leaders who will manage your on-site team, ensuring smooth operation and communication between your local and offshore teams.

The process of forming your offshore team is not an overnight task but a gradual process. It's recommended to build your team from the ground up, focusing initially on hiring the right individuals who can evolve into team leaders. This approach has two benefits. 

Firstly, these individuals get to understand the nuances of your business from the start, and secondly, they grow along with the team, giving them an in-depth understanding of your offshore operations.

Let's look at the process more closely. Start by hiring individuals for the key roles in your offshore team, ensuring they possess the necessary skills and aptitude for the job. Once these individuals are in place, identify the ones who show leadership potential. These could be individuals who excel in their tasks, show a knack for problem-solving, and have the ability to inspire their colleagues. 

Promote these individuals to leadership roles, giving them the responsibility to manage their respective teams.

Another critical aspect of structuring your offshore team is establishing a strong line of communication between the team leaders and your local team. Regular meetings, updates, and performance reports should be standard practices, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

Lastly, keep in mind that your offshore team structure should not be rigid. As your business grows and evolves, you may need to tweak your team structure, add new roles, or even create new teams. This adaptability is key to maintaining an efficient and productive offshore team.

In the next chapter, we will guide you through the hiring process with ShoreAgents, providing insights into how we find and filter the right talent for your team. 

Chapter 4: Hiring Process with ShoreAgents
Now that you have a clear understanding of your team structure and the roles you need to fill, the next step is hiring the right people. At ShoreAgents, we strive to make the hiring process as efficient and effective as possible. Let's look at how we do it.

Firstly, we submit work orders for each job role you provide. These orders outline the skills, experience, and qualifications required for each position. With these specifications in mind, we then search the market for suitable candidates. With our extensive database of 25,000 candidates specializing in real estate roles, we have a rich pool of talent to draw from.

Next, we conduct a thorough screening process. This begins with arranging interviews with candidates who pass our initial suitability assessment and required tests. Our success team conducts a one-on-one company interview with each candidate over Zoom, recording the call for your review. This not only saves you time but also allows you to make informed decisions.

Once the interviews are complete, we provide you with the candidates' resumes, test results, and interview recordings. You can review this information at your convenience and select candidates for a final interview. We then schedule Zoom calls at a time that suits your team members, allowing them to conduct the final interviews. This is your chance to ask role-specific questions and assess if the candidates are a good fit for your company.

Upon your satisfaction with the candidates, you notify us of your hiring decisions. We take it from there, sending out job offers and arranging start dates for each new team member.

At ShoreAgents, we strive to streamline the hiring process, ensuring you get the right talent for your team without the usual hassles and time-consuming processes of traditional recruitment.

In the next chapter, we will discuss onboarding and training, providing you with insights on how to ensure a smooth start for your new team members. 


Chapter 5: Onboarding and Training with ShoreAgents
Once you have selected your new team members, the next step is onboarding and training. This phase is critical as it sets the stage for how your new employees will integrate into your organization and their specific roles. With ShoreAgents, we aim to make this process as seamless as possible.

The first part of the onboarding process involves setting start dates for your new hires. It's a good practice to have employees in similar roles start on the same day. This facilitates group training and allows team members to form bonds from the outset, which can enhance team cohesion.

Before your workforce starts, consider the tools and software they will need to effectively carry out their tasks. Ensure they have the necessary access to these resources from day one. This could involve anything from specific project management software to access to certain company databases or platforms.

Alongside this, a comprehensive training plan is vital to guide their role for the first month, three months, and beyond. This should cover all tasks they will be responsible for and any company-specific processes or protocols they need to follow. Remember, it's your responsibility to train staff members on their assigned tasks within your business.

Regarding onboarding, ShoreAgents schedules a separate call with you or the relevant person in your business to ensure readiness. We onboard the staff members, ensuring they have everything they need and are prepared for their first day. Our team will introduce you to your dedicated account manager, who will coordinate with your team for day-one planning and other requirements.

The goal of onboarding and training is not only to familiarize your new hires with their roles but also to make them feel part of your organization. A well-structured onboarding process can boost employee engagement, productivity, and retention, so it's worth investing the time and resources to get it right.

In the next chapter, we will delve into managing your offshore team, providing you with insights into effective communication, performance monitoring, and engagement strategies. 

Chapter 6: Managing Your Offshore Team
Successfully managing an offshore team can seem daunting. However, with clear communication, effective performance monitoring, and strong engagement strategies, you can ensure that your offshore team is as productive and cohesive as your local team.

Project management software is crucial when it comes to managing a large team. Tools like ClickUp, Airtable, Monday, and SANA offer a range of features that allow you to track tasks, deadlines, and the overall performance of your staff. By implementing such software, you can monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and manage workload distribution effectively.

Communication is another vital aspect of team management. Clear, consistent, and open communication ensures that your offshore team fully understands their responsibilities, is aware of any changes or updates, and feels comfortable voicing any concerns or suggestions. 

Reliable platforms such as Slack or WhatsApp can facilitate smooth and efficient communication within your workforce. Remember, regular team meetings and one-on-one sessions with team members can also enhance communication and build stronger relationships.

ShoreAgents also provides support for staff management. We adopt a three-tiered approach that includes regular check-ins, monthly catch-up sessions, and performance reviews. Regular check-ins, especially in the initial months, allow us to provide feedback and support to new team members. Monthly catch-up sessions enable us to address any issues and maintain open lines of communication. 

Performance reviews, conducted in the first, third, and fifth months, determine whether a staff member will become a regular employee, as per the labor laws in the Philippines.
In addition to performance management, employee engagement is paramount. 

ShoreAgents prioritizes creating a productive and happy workplace environment, organizing various activities and events to celebrate holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, and outstanding performance. We encourage you to also implement your own initiatives to foster a sense of belonging and alignment with your company culture.

In the next chapter, we will talk about the physical workspace, detailing how ShoreAgents provides a conducive environment for your offshore team. 

Chapter 7: Physical Workspace for Your Offshore Team
In an offshore work environment, the physical workspace your team operates in can play a crucial role in their productivity, engagement, and overall job satisfaction. ShoreAgents understands the importance of creating a suitable work environment for your offshore team, and we have various strategies in place to support this.

Firstly, we offer private workspaces for your team. These workspaces are designed to provide a conducive environment for your employees, fostering productivity and efficiency. Importantly, these workspaces can be customized to reflect your branding, establishing a sense of your own office for your offshore team. This not only enhances a feeling of professionalism and commitment but also reinforces your team's connection to your business.

As your workforce expands, we provide discounts to reflect the economies of scale achieved. This means you can continue to provide a high-quality work environment for your growing team, without the costs spiraling out of control.


Apart from the physical environment, we also provide a ticketing system for both clients and staff members. This system allows you to request tasks or catch up with the success team. Similarly, your staff members can use it to report any issues or request equipment upgrades. By doing so, we ensure that your team has the tools they need to perform their roles effectively and that any issues are promptly addressed.

To navigate the challenges that may arise in managing an offshore team, especially those related to cultural differences, ShoreAgents provides dedicated support. Think of our success team as your dedicated concierge service, there to guide you through the process and ensure a smooth experience.
In the final chapter, we will discuss how to tackle challenges you may face while building your offshore team and how ShoreAgents assists in overcoming these hurdles. 


Chapter 8: Overcoming Challenges in Building Your Offshore Team

Building and managing a large offshore team can come with its unique set of challenges. Cultural differences, language barriers, and time zone disparities can impact various aspects of your team's functioning. However, with a strategic approach and the right support, these challenges can be navigated effectively.

At ShoreAgents, we have successfully helped many companies build their workforces in the Philippines, guiding them through potential obstacles and providing solutions. Here are some common challenges and how we address them:

Cultural Differences: Differences in work culture and social norms can impact communication, negotiation, and overall team dynamics. Our success team has an in-depth understanding of both Western and Filipino cultures and is well-equipped to bridge this gap. We assist you in navigating sensitive topics such as discussing salaries and performance, ensuring that all communication respects and takes into account cultural nuances.
Language Barriers: Although English is widely spoken in the Philippines, there may be times when language barriers pose a challenge. To mitigate this, we ensure all our candidates have a strong proficiency in English and are comfortable in a global work environment.
Time Zone Disparities: Different time zones can impact collaboration and communication within the team. However, the flexibility and willingness of the Filipino workforce to adapt to different work schedules can significantly help in overcoming this challenge.
Performance Management: Managing performance from afar can be a challenge. Our three-tiered approach to staff management, which includes regular check-ins, monthly catch-up sessions, and performance reviews, ensures that performance standards are met and any issues are promptly addressed.
Engagement and Integration: Building a sense of belonging and connection with your company can be more challenging with an offshore team. To tackle this, ShoreAgents organizes various activities and events for your team. We encourage you to implement your own initiatives to further foster integration and alignment with your company culture.

Building an offshore team is a journey, one that can lead to immense growth and success for your company. While there may be hurdles along the way, with ShoreAgents by your side, you'll be well-equipped to overcome them. If you are ready to start building your offshore workforce, schedule a Zoom meeting with us. We look forward to guiding you through this exciting venture!

Chapter 1: Understanding Workforce with ShoreAgents
At ShoreAgents, we define a workforce as a group of staff members numbering six or more. Our specific service guide is designed to meet the unique requirements that come with building a larger workforce, as opposed to forming a smaller team or hiring a single agent. This guide will help you understand how to effectively structure and manage your workforce with us.

The first step towards building a workforce with ShoreAgents is a clear understanding of your internal team structure. This is crucial because when establishing a workforce in the Philippines, different teams or groups of team members are required to specialize in various sectors. Let's consider an example.

Suppose you run a property development business, and you plan to outsource certain operations, like your finance department, contract administration, property marketing, and general back-office tasks. In that case, you would require distinct teams for each area. This could mean needing three contract administrators, five staff members for your finance department, five for basic admin support, six for property marketing, and perhaps a few drafters.

It's crucial that you identify team leaders within your organization who will be responsible for managing these divisions in the Philippines. They will serve as your primary points of contact and will be responsible for maintaining smooth operations.

Remember, building a workforce isn't just about hiring a group of people to complete tasks. It's about creating a well-structured, efficient, and collaborative system that ensures your business runs smoothly. By taking the time to understand what a workforce really means and how it applies to your business, you're already on your way to building a successful team with ShoreAgents.

In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into how you can evaluate your current team structure and how to adapt it for your workforce in the Philippines. Continue reading to learn more!

Chapter 2: Evaluating Your Team Structure
Once you have a solid understanding of what building a workforce with ShoreAgents entails, the next step is to evaluate your internal team structure. This is a crucial process that will shape your offshore team and determine its efficiency and effectiveness.

The goal is to create a structure that complements your existing operations and maximizes the capabilities of your offshore team. This involves understanding the roles you need to fill, the number of individuals required for each role, and who will manage each team.

If you operate a property development business and plan to outsource various functions, for example, you need to determine how many individuals you require in each department. This could be three contract administrators, five in finance, five in basic administration, six in property marketing, and perhaps a few drafters. This assessment helps you understand the scale of your offshore team.

Next, identify team leaders within your organization who will oversee these divisions in the Philippines. These leaders should be capable of managing the team, understanding their needs, and ensuring their performance aligns with your company's goals. These team leaders will act as the bridge between your local and offshore teams, ensuring a seamless flow of communication and effective coordination.

It's crucial to remember that your offshore team's structure should mirror your organization's culture and values. Ensure that the roles, responsibilities, and hierarchy align with your business ethos and are designed to promote collaboration and productivity.

Evaluating your internal team structure is not a one-time process but should be an ongoing activity. As your business grows and evolves, your team structure should also adapt to accommodate new roles, increased workload, and operational changes.

In the next chapter, we will delve deeper into how to structure your offshore team in the Philippines, focusing on how to choose leaders and foster growth. 

Chapter 3: Structuring Your Offshore Team
After evaluating your team structure, the next step is to form the structure of your offshore team in the Philippines. Here, you need to designate leaders who will manage your on-site team, ensuring smooth operation and communication between your local and offshore teams.

The process of forming your offshore team is not an overnight task but a gradual process. It's recommended to build your team from the ground up, focusing initially on hiring the right individuals who can evolve into team leaders. This approach has two benefits.

Allow Us to Help Manage Your Staff
A Three-Tiered Approach
When you manage employees locally, you’re 100 percent in control. However, when your staff is located on the other side of the world, it can present minor challenges. But don’t worry; we have you covered.

ShoreAgents has a three-tiered approach — via Performance Reviews, Catch-Ups and Check-Ins — to managing the performance and relationship you have with your remote team members. Acquiring feedback from all parties and points of view is vital to your team’s success. We obtain feedback from you, your organization, your remote staff members and our own staff investigations.

Performance Reviews
No one is as fit to comment on the performance of your staff as you. After all, you’ll be the one administering the work and conducting worker training daily; we rely on you to take responsibility for these tasks. We’ll reach out to you in interviews held during the first, third and fifth months following your hire(s) (and annually thereafter) to provide critical feedback.

Feedback will specifically be related to a team member’s:
Quality of work
Desire to improve
Job knowledge
Communication
Teamwork
Time management
Reliability
Overall attendance

When we receive this feedback, we’ll assess the comments for each worker individually and take actions as necessary (including meeting with you and the individual team member) to help you avoid any future pain or negative consequences for your business. If it’s appropriate, we can implement training plans to help your staff improve in and explore new areas.

Catch-Ups
Catch-Ups with your remote workers are undertaken monthly by our success team. We do this to get feedback from them about how they’re handling working with you and your internal staff. We believe in shouldering this responsibility, as there may be information they’re more comfortable sharing privately with us. We use this information to help them improve in areas they may be struggling with or are eager to learn more about. They may even have suggestions that would help you and your business.

Once we receive this worker feedback, we’ll conduct a one-on-one session with each team member to discuss the results in detail. We’ll put together a monthly action plan and then extend an opportunity for you to have a discussion with us about our findings. This will tell you how the satisfaction level of your team members (rated as “happy,” “satisfied” or “unhappy”) relates to their tasks and work environment.

Check-Ins
During the early days of your new staff engagements, we’ll check in weekly to ensure your hires are fitting into their roles and the office environment. A successful start is essential for every new team member, and Check-Ins help us to identify critical areas of your business where we believe additional workers can offer the most assistance and value. With every Check-In, our success team will assess the ongoing work and worker performance levels and provide feedback to you and your team.

These Check-Ins will be conducted regularly every week until you feel they’re no longer needed and/or your team member is settled in and performing to the best of their ability. If, at any point during your worker’s engagement, you or your organization feels the need for such Check-Ins to resume, simply let us know, and we’ll re-institute them until you advise us to do otherwise.

This three-tiered approach to staff management is extremely important for your remote working success.

Staff Engagement
Keeping your staff happy in their work setting is one of our top priorities, and we excel at it. All our engagements are geared toward encouraging performance for clients and making team members’ work environments great places to be, so they can attract your next superstar team members.
Day 1
From the day your new staff members start, we’ll have already engaged them on your behalf to ensure their happiness and excitement for their new jobs remain robust. And it doesn’t stop there.

Employee of the Month
We have a unique scoring system covering multiple areas that selects an Employee of the Month every month. A team member can only achieve this prestigious distinction by blowing your expectations for them out of the water. We have micro prizes for each job area to encourage all team members to excel and other awards to encourage the entire team.

Work Anniversary
Celebrating life events is an established tradition in the Philippines, and work anniversaries are among the most important of these. Commemorating these events with showers of gifts and praise for your workers ensures a long tenure for your team as they celebrate each passing year; we encourage you to join in and help make these festivities special.

Monthly Activities
Monthly fun and games make commuting to our office worthwhile for your workers. These games are carefully selected to fit culturally and amuse them; we understand your team members and what pleases them.

Birthdays
We never miss a birthday, as birthdays are important and memorable occasions in the Philippines. Birthdays are occasions when workers can talk informally with their colleagues and get to know them better. The more friends your team members make at work, the more likely they’ll be to stay at their job.

Clubs
ShoreAgents maintains several different activity clubs for team members to enjoy doing things they love after work. Some of these include the Shore Book Club, the Shore Photography Club, the Shore Music Club and the Shore Fitness Club.

Endless Free Coffee and Subsidized Food

Free coffee and subsidized food are provided to team members so they’ll have no shortage of energy and motivation.

Free Shuttles
All of the above elements will ensure that your team members are 100 percent satisfied; however, we don’t stop there — we’ll also consult with you on additional means you can employ to maintain a successful working relationship with your workers.

Introducing the Success Team
Our success team is always on call to help you through the outsourcing journey, and we’ll guide you from the moment you select your first new workers to the period when they’re fully engaged with your organization. You’ll always have direct access to our team of experts for literally anything you need support with.

Workers are paid for local public holidays, which include Philippines Holidays and ones you are more familiar with like Christmas, Labor Day, and Independence Day.
Employment Benefits
These are the standard benefits for every worker, which include those outlined above and all supporting services.
Over and Undertime
Overtime is calculated at 1.5 times base salary. Undertime is base salary deducted from a worker’s pay for any unscheduled time they’re not present.

Sample Costs
Your per-worker costs will be comprised of the one-time Setup Fee, the Ongoing Membership Fees, and your Staff Costs, all of which are outlined above.

The formula for ongoing Payment Per Remote Staff

Every Staff You Hire = Membership Fee Per Staff = Monthly Invoice


The formula for Ongoing Payment Per Remote Worker = Membership Fee Per Worker + Individual Staff Costs and any other associated charges = Your Monthly Invoice. Different workers will cost different amounts based on their roles and your ShoreAgents Membership Level. Some sample costs for different Membership Levels are below:
